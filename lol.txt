Seven centuries in the future, the sport of American football has never been bigger, never been faster, never been more lethal. Trillions of fans from all over the galaxy watch six unique races battle in contests so violent that deaths are part of the stat sheet. Star quarterback Quentin Barnes has led his beloved Ionath Krakens to glory on the gridiron and become the most-recognized individual in history, but it is off the field where his world crumbles around him. Over four seasons with Ionath, he's picked up powerful enemies: one of which drove his sister into the Portath Cloud, a place from which no ship returns. Because his enemies include his team owner— a possessive crime lord who treats players like property—and the ruling government that controls the shipping lanes, Quentin and his friends must hide from the media spotlight as they search for a way to rescue his sister.

Is it possible that instead, book destruction can be turned into beautiful and inspiring works of art?</P>
<P>That's the premise behind a new book from distinguished designer and photographer, Julius Friedman. Titled simply, <I>The Book</I>, Friedman's latest project is an art book made possible by the sacrifice of several other beautiful books for the pieces within.</P>
<P>"<I>The Book </I>project was inspired by Gail Gilbert, the art librarian at the University of Louisville Library, when she gave me a bag of books she was discarding," Friedman noted. "She thought I could tear them up and make collages or an art project. I told her I was not a collage artist and, being a book designer, I could not tear them up. After months of them sitting in my basement and Gail saying, 'Do something with them,' I made my first deconstruction and collage," he added.</P>
<P>Those first collages grew into a body of work, and later, a limited edition of 20 books, all hand-sewn and hand-bound, using hand-set type, letterpress, and tipped-in photographs—and a box made of cherry wood to house each copy. The "run" sold out immediately. "After that project, I continued to make collages and decided to do a coffee table book that people from all walks of life could afford, enjoy, and experience," the artist added.</P>
<P>The result is stunning. In 130 beautiful photographs, Friedman gives his torn-apart and twisted books fascinating shapes and structures, some lit from within or without, ranging from the abstract to the concrete, and from the visceral to the intellectual. "I looked at the book from its beginnings to the current and emerging world of the Kindle and other electronic tablets, intuitively keeping in mind the sacred word, censorship, holding an object, its tactile way, even the smell of a book," he stated.</P>
<P><I>The Book</I> will be loved, ironically, by book lovers who will recognize how the artist has harnessed the tactile power of books and transformed them into new and moving forms for his art.</P><P>JULIUS FRIEDMAN is a graphic designer, photographer and artist specializing in cultural, nonprofit, and corporate design.

This may bring us more imaginations: in the future, should the employers trace their employees' movement in work places? Can the colour of an interior wall change the way that we think and perceive? Even do you need an actual office now? The answers may be varied. But we are sure that the design of work place is changing in the role of enhancing working efficiency. This book unfolds in accordance to this idea. We have to admit that with the development of age of big data, work places are changing from a spatial order of "I" to that of "We." Changes are constant and develop with social developments. We hope this book will trigger readers' deep thoughts.Matthew Driscoll co-founded Threefold Architects with Jack Hosea in 2004.

It explores the part that Rama and Arguedas played in the conceptualization and promotion of new cultural spaces made possible by commodification and industrialization, as capitalism transformed the imaginaries and materialities that had shaped their cultural projects for Andean and Latin American cultures. Through a material analysis of print culture objects, in particular those resulting from Rama's editorial ventures—such as pocket paperbacks and a popular encyclopedia—this work examines the transformations occurring at the time in Latin America at the level of production and circulation of culture, and thus sheds light on the emergence of new networks of communication between intellectuals and national and regional publics. Similarly, it explores the role of emergent communication technologies (sound recording and radio) in the reshaping of rural indigenous cultures into a mass-oriented popular culture in Peru. In this context, Arguedas's work with folklore and his later involvement in the Andean popular music scene in Lima are studied as responses to a violent process of commercialization of traditional Andean musical culture, a result of mass migration from rural areas to cities and urbanization. Finally, this book presents an understanding of Rama and Arguedas that transcends their categorization as literary critic and writer, respectively, by analyzing their work through the concept of practice, which encompasses the totality of their work, including journalism, anthropology, folklore, editorial work, intellectual networking, and cultural promotion. Its chapters invite a rethinking of established notions of the relation between culture and capitalism during the heyday of revolution in the Latin American intellectual field.Javier García Liendo is an assistant professor of Spanish at Washington University in St. Louis. He received his PhD in Latin American literatures and cultures from Princeton University, and also holds a BA in Peruvian and Latin American literature from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (Peru). Before his doctoral studies, he worked and conducted research on orality and literacy in the Peruvian Amazon. His research centers on Andean literature and culture, Latin American intellectual and cultural history, immigration, and mass culture.Creating Moments of Joy Along the Alzheimer's JourneyA Guide for Families and Caregivers, Fifth Edition, Revised and ExpandedJolene Brackey<p>Author Jolene Brackey has a vision: to help families, caregivers, and people with Alzheimer's disease create joy together in the face of one of the most devastating diseases in the world today. </p><p>When people have short-term memory loss, their lives are made up of moments.

Oliver had been alive at ten forty-six, when he spoke to me on the phone. Fergusson had appeared at Joyce's door at ten fifty-seven. That gave him eleven minutes at the very outside to shoot Oliver, plant the negatives in the safe and make his way from the office to Joyce's flat. In normal conditions it was just feasible, for it was a seven or eight minutes' drive from the office to the flat. But in the fog we had that night it was out of the question. It was even worse at the other end. Fergusson left Joyce at eleven twenty-eight. I found Oliver's body about eleven thirty-five. Again, seven minutes was far too short for Fergusson to do all he would have to do. In any case we had the medical evidence that Oliver had died not later than eleven-thirty and Sheila's evidence that he was already dead when she died at a quarter-past-eleven. And yet I had a conviction that somehow Fergusson had done it. The alibi was too neat and artificial. As Joyce herself had remarked, for Fergusson to call on her at that time of night was astonishingly out of character; especially as he seemed to have no pressing reason for his visit.</i><br></p>The 10 Worst PsychopathsThe Most Depraved Killers in HistoryVictor McQueenOften, the term <i>psychopath</i> tends to be equated with violent and deranged criminality, but true psychopaths are very different from the way they are portrayed in film or on television. They are aware of the difference between right and wrong: they simply choose to ignore anything that prevents them getting what they want. Real-life psychopaths are not 'mad' but 'bad', but they appear on the surface to be entirely 'normal'. One of the pioneers of  modern research was Dr. Robert Hare, who developed the <i>Psychopathy Check List Revised (PCL-R)</i> in an attempt to describe the degree of psychopathy an individual displays. The clusters of personality traits and socially-deviant behaviors outlined in the check-list are separated into four types: interpersonal, affective, lifestyle and anti-social. The 10 Worst Psychopaths looks at history's most notorious and infamous psychopaths, and seeks to show how their life stories illustrate these classic psychopathic personality traits. Though all morally despicable, the frightening truth is that many of these individuals were charming, popular and charismatic. This is part of our enduring fascination with the psychopath: they are capable of extraordinary inhuman acts, and yet they appear on the surface to be entirely 'normal'. It is only once you know what to look for that the psychopathy beneath the cunning mask becomes obvious. Victor McQueen served as a police officer for over 30 years. He became a full-time writer after taking early retirement, and has a particular interest in true-life crime. He currently lives with his wife Anna, who is a practicing criminal psychologist.Sam GiancanaThe Rise and Fall of a Chicago MobsterSusan McNicollSent to the Reformatory at the age of ten, Sicilian-American Sam Giancana would work to create a gilded life as mobster and mob boss at a pivotal point in history when the mafia decided who ruled America, who lived - and who died. Born in 1908, in The Patch, Chicago, Giancana joined the Forty-Two gang of lawless juvenile punks in 1921 and quickly proved himself as a skilled 'wheel man' (or getaway driver), extortionist and vicious killer. Called up to the ranks of the Outfit, he reputedly held talks with the CIA about assassinating Fidel Castro, shared a girlfriend with John F. Kennedy, and had friends in high places, including Sammy Davis Jr., Frank Sinatra, Shirley MacLaine, Marilyn Monroe and, some say, the Kennedys, although he fell out with them. This book profiles the famous Chicago mobster's life, and will overturn many of your beliefs about America during the Kennedy era, with the rumors of Giancana's role in the famous brothers' deaths and the intrigue surrounding the death of Marilyn Monroe detailed here.

The family moved to London in 1823, but their fortunes were severely impaired. Dickens was sent to work in a blacking-warehouse when his father was imprisoned for debt.

Records show that he was baptised at Stratford-upon-Avon during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I in 1564. He married Anne Hathaway at the age of 18 and had three children with her. At some point he went to London and found his way into the theatrical profession, as an actor, playwright, poet and, latterly, theatre manager and impresario. Shakespeare's various enterprises brought him wealth, and he used his money to secure his family's position, acquiring property in London as well as back home in Stratford. He died in April 1616, aged 52. The body of work left by Shakespeare included 37 plays, four poems, and a collection of sonnets, but the legacy of his work cannot be measured. The Oscar Wilde CollectionA Selection of His Greatest WorkOscar Wilde<p>Here's a beautiful slipcase edition of a selection of writings from the pen of one of the wittiest men who ever lived - Oscar Wilde.

Shortly after his marriage Wilde accepted the editorship of<i> Lady's World</i>, an obscure magazine whose fortunes he revived. Simultaneously, his own writing career entered its most fertile period.

He suffered from ill health, at one point having a nervous breakdown, and he was unable to attend university, which was a huge disappointment to him. He died in 1937. But his legacy lives on in a body of work that has inspired countless films, TV series, board games and toys, as well as many other writers.The Way of the SamuraiInazo Nitobe<p>This classic text by Inazo Nitobe defining the moral code of the warrior class or Samurai has had a huge impact both in the West and in Japan itself.

What's the point of living the way I do, day in and day out? Twenty-five hundred years ago, in his youth, Buddha (Sakyamuni) had the same nagging questions that we do today. He never avoided them or gave up the search for answers, but devoted himself earnestly to discovering the meaning of life. That search is the starting point of Buddhism.

In our desire to live with strength and good cheer, the life of Buddha is sure to provide invaluable insight.Born in Shimane Prefecture in 1970, Hisashi Ota graduated from Nagoya University's School of Science.

If that�s what we really want, we should start planting seeds of happiness. The kind of flower you get depends on the seed you have planted: this is a law of nature. In the same way, if you plant the seeds of happiness, the flowers of happiness will bloom. Seeds of happiness, seeds of unhappiness� which are you mostly planting? In addition to my work of giving seminars throughout the country as a lecturer on Buddhism, I continue to give advice through my email newsletter and my blog. Buddhism teaches us the law of cause and effect that enables us to become �a happier me.� All I am doing is applying that clear law to the troubles that various people have, explaining things in a way that will be easy for them to understand. So, how can we make sure the flowers of happiness bloom for us? I�d like to help by discussing the troubles of people whom I�ve encountered over these past few years.

Photography by Julie Soefer, Michael CordA quarter century ago, a Nicaraguan born in the American Canal Zone became a chef with a restaurant in Houston, Texas. That eatery, called Churrascos after a style of beef cookery then unknown in the United States, became a hit despite its most obvious failing: it was Latin but not Tex-Mex, and involved no tacos, enchiladas, or burritos. The Cordua family became a Texas restaurant legend, the success story behind several locations of Churrascos, the soaring Artista at Houston's Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, the casual-fun Amazon Grill, and what perhaps is the family's ultimate culinary and architectural signature, Americas.

And as the author of dozens of cookbooks over many years, DeMers also shares the top 100 recipes he's learned how to make for his own friends and family from interviewing, cooking, and tasting alongside chefs like Emeril Lagasse in New Orleans, Robert del Grande in Houston, Stephan Pyles in Dallas, and Jimmy Bannos in Chicago. On the recipe front (with some great stories attached), this book describes John's efforts to make his beloved chicken and sausage gumbo in the far West Texas town of Marfa (pop. 1980), his encounter with stone crab soup in Everglades City, Florida, the amazing salad dressing that's apparently made only at the bottom of the Grand Canyon, and others.A veteran Texas-based journalist, John DeMers is the author of fifty published books on subjects from food and drink, to Texas culture, history, to a popular series of crime novels set in far West Texas.

Fischer, Mark Wieser, John DeMers & Nancy Marr, Mark  Wieser, John  DeMers, Nancy  MarrFor more than a quarter-century, the founders of Fischer and Wieser—the flavor-crazed dynamic duo of Case Fischer and Mark Wieser—have introduced a larger world to the flavors of Texas. Starting with a handful of jams and jellies, the specialty food company they founded in a peach orchard has launched hundreds of different sauces for every step of the cooking and eating process, including their original creation built around roasted raspberries and a then-little-known pepper known as chipotle. In the pages of this cookbook, Case and Mark tell their stories—the discoveries of their culinary creations, the values and creativity that lie at the heart of their business success, and the town they have called home throughout their exciting journey. This collection of recipes brings a little bit of Texas and an enormous amount of flavor with every dish and is sure to ignite readers' passion for the kitchen.Fischer & Wieser Specialty Foods, a family business in the Texas Hill Country, has proved what its German founders always believed: If you're honest and have a quality product, people will keep buying it. Fischer & Wieser is very much a family business. In 1969, Mark Weiser founded a jelly shop in his family's peach orchard. He taught school when he wasn't in the orchard, and one of his students, Case D. Fischer, now president and CEO of the company, developed such a love for the business that he went off to college to study food and fiber marketing. He returned home full of ideas and he and Wieser became business partners.Buzzed:Beers, Booze, & Coffee BrewsA Guide to the Best Craft Beverages in New EnglandErik Ofgang<P>Buzzed boldly goes where no New England craft beverage book has gone before, tapping New England's burgeoning craft beer industry, the region's longtime coffeehouse culture, and the up-and-coming world of craft distilling.

When Jack's significant other, social service worker Roxanne Masterson, investigates allegations of physical abuse concerning the young daughter of Boston bluebloods David and Maddie Connelly, Jack senses a story.

In this deftly written jewel of a novel, veteran author Jim Nichols strings together the bittersweet stories of several different characters bound together by shared geography and the insular nature of small-town life. There's Johnny Lunden, a well-meaning war veteran with a penchant for the local bar and a deep but doomed love for his family. There's eight-year-old Ted Soule, who shares a first kiss with the Ophelia-like Nadia, the daughter of his Russian neighbors, and Tomi Lambert who observes the confusion of the adults around her as they struggle with accepting their fates. With the coastal waters of Maine as a backdrop, Nichols artfully explores the nature of connection—hoped for, missed, lost, and found—in <i>Closer All the Time</i>, that very special novel that delivers quick-moving, compelling storytelling with a lasting emotional wallop. You'll devour it in one sitting, but its characters will linger at the edges of your day like memories of old friends and lovers. Author Monica Wood has given it advance praise, saying: "His men and boys become so real, I feel as if I know what it might have been like to grow up surrounded by brothers.

Rosaire's younger brother Ambroise arrives in town to identify the body. Ambroise worshiped his brother and wants answers. While investigators suspect a crime of passion, Ambroise has a very different theory. Polynya delves into the mysterious and poetic polar world of Baffin Island, where a cast of characters live on the margins and everyone is not necessarily to be believed.Mélanie Vincelette is already a respected figure of the Quebec literary world. Polynya was short listed for the Governor General's Award for French-language fiction in 2011 and was voted the best book of 2011 by La Presse. Her first novel, Crimes horticoles (Horticultural Crimes) was published in 2006 and won the Anne Hébert Prize. In 2006, she won the Radio Canada Book Award. Vincelette lives in Montreal.

In <i>Treadmill</i>, the characters of Nakamura's novel suffer a similar fate he experienced in his own life. Prior to the War, Nakamura worked as the English editor for a large Tokyo newspaper and in Manchuria. After he returned to the U.S., he was incarcerated in the Salinas Assembly Center, in Salina, California. </p><p><i>Treadmill</i> is a unique novel, providing an exceptional look into life in Japanese-American internment camps as that singular way of life was being played out. Nakamura exquisitely captures the thinking and mood of the people, and accurately evokes the fears, anxieties, suspicions, cynicisms and passions they brought to the camp. </p><p>The author almost had <i>Treadmill</i> successfully published in the late 1940s, however it was deemed too controversial for publication that close to the end of the war. Sadly, Nakamura died in 1973, never having seen his work in book form. Twenty years later, Professor Peter Suzuki discovered the manuscript in the National Archives and shepherded this unique novel to publication. </p><p>This revised new edition includes a new Foreword detailing the importance of <i>Treadmill</i> in the history of Japanese-American World War II internment, as well as a new series of historical photographs of that troubling time in American history. </p>Hiroshi Nakamura was born in Gilroy, California, in 1915 and graduated from UC Berkeley in 1937. After working in Japan, he returned to America and was incarcerated in the Salinas Assembly Center, in Salina California where he completed Treadmill. Nakamura tried unsuccessfully to get Treadmill published after the War and died in 1973 before it was published.TransitionsYael Dayan, Maya Klein<p>Yael Dayan, novelist daughter of the legendary Israeli politician Moshe Dayan and​ a public figure with a long and illustrious political career behind her, looks back at her life, scrutinizing it without illusions, in this provocative and moving memoir. </p><p>Once a desirable, free-spirited young woman and a successful author, she lived with the sense that she held the world in the palm of her hand. And the world adulated both her and the young state she came from. She was an officer in the Israel Defense Force, the daughter of a renowned general, a successful writer—<i>Death Had Two Sons</i>, <i>A Soldier's Diary: Sinai 1967</i>—much in demand on the lecture tour, and a star of the gossip columns. Now in her 70s, Dayan admits with touching honesty to missing both the vibrant 20-something she was, and the sober woman she became—a fierce political activist and parliamentarian for the left, a fighter for justice, women's rights, and peace. Having resigned her last public position, she must reconcile herself to being a mentor, a participant instead of a leader, yet remaining center-stage on the Peace Camp scene. The narrator's warm, intimate voice and her rich intellect, as well as her insights, make for a powerful reading experience.</p>Yael Dayan served as a member of the Israeli Knesset between 1992 and 2003, and from 2008 to 2013 was the chair of Tel Aviv city council. She was an officer in the Israel Defense Force and made a name for herself as an author and newspaper columnist, writing columns for Yedioth Ahronoth, Ma'ariv, Al HaMishmar and Davar.She has published five novels as well as a memoir of the Six-Day War called Israel Journal: June 1967 and a biography of her father called My Father,

The story begins with Awadh Jaggernath's four grandparents, who desperately wanted to free themselves from the curse of the Indian caste system. They voluntarily indenture themselves to the sugarcane plantations in Trinidad with the hope of freedom after their five year contract ends. Living with his parents and grandparents, Jaggernath documents the struggles and way of life of his grandparents and his parents. He colours his story with vivid and compelling details of the vibrant multicul¬tural society, the lives of his immediate and extended family and his friends and the discipline, joys and sorrows, the sexual exploitations, early loves and intimacies of his youth. This is more than a memoir… it is an intimate and vivid family and personal history told in a remarkable language which captures the tonality and rhythm of Trinidadian speech. Nothing is left untold. This memoir, in terms of its honesty, finally pulls the curtain open on the real life of this man, his family, his village and his youth in Trinidad.Awadh Jaggernath was born in Trinidad where he was educated under the British education system. He taught in ele¬mentary and secondary schools, as well as for the extra-mural department of the University of the West Indies in Trinidad. In the 1960s, he immigrated to Canada to further his education at McMaster University, University of Toronto, Brock University and York University. For decades he taught mathematics and science at the collegiate level for the Toronto District School Board and the Halton Public and Separate School Boards. He is now retired and lives in Oakville.The Missing KennedyRosemary Kennedy and the Secret Bonds of Four WomenElizabeth Koehler-Pentacoff<p>Now in paperback! Throughout her childhood, Elizabeth Koehler-Pentacoff frequently visited Rosemary Kennedy, President John F. Kennedy's sister. Why? Koehler-Pentacoff's aunt, Sister Paulus Koehler, a Franciscan nun, was Rosemary's devoted caregiver at St. Coletta in Jefferson, Wisconsin, for fifteen years and her driver and travel companion for over thirty. The resulting book chronicles Rosie's life along with that of the author's aunt, and delves into the similarities between the two families. It includes more than 100 photos, many of them never before seen, private Kennedy quotes from the author's interviews, and anecdotes about Rosemary and her famous family. The book delves into Rosemary's misdiagnosed condition, why her father sought an experimental brain surgery for her without his wife's knowledge, how he kept this fact hidden from the rest of his family for twenty years, and what Rosemary was actually like after her lobotomy. </p><p>"<i>The Missing Kennedy</i> is a truly inspiring story.

Now, <i>From Matriarch to Mayor</i> brings the strong Kempner women into the light and shows their role in the family's life across generations. </p><p>Author Elise H. Stephens provides the individual stories of four generations of Kempner women, whose strength and commitment transformed their community as their men were building the Imperial Sugar Company and the Kempner Fund. From philanthropy to volunteer work, each of these women was eager to use her talents in service to city, state and country. Anecdotes, letters, journal entries, and personal photographs illustrate the importance of the women in the family, and provide insight into the Kempners' traditions and beliefs, their way of life, and the often-dramatic times in which they lived. </p><p>Stephens presents over a dozen of the family's women—some calm and collected, some bold and brash, all fascinating. As new generations of this strong family emerge as mainstays of Galveston, Texas and beyond, this well-researched and engaging history creates a window into both the formation and the perpetuation of a significant family dynasty in American history. </p>A historian by training, humanist by persuasion, activist by experience, and optimist in the face of adversity, Elise Hopkins Stephens brings to the telling of the Kempner Women's story a rare combination of candor and compassion supported by thorough scholarship and research into her subjects.

When he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, he refused to let the news alter his fundamental perspective. Robert viewed this unexpected hurdle as an opportunity: the debilitating disease granted him the gift of time to pursue his artistic interests. Through photography, he discovered the beauty in his own backyard and the immense healing power of art. Taking vivid photographs of the wonders he had previously overlooked helped him cope, and he realized the power of the beauty he observed could help others, too. </p><p>Despite his physical limitations, he began traveling the world to pursue this passion that made him feel so intensely alive. Robert's irrepressible good nature, patience, and undeniable talent have resulted in this collection of images - both intimate and grand - that showcase the wonders that surround each of us, if we take the time to look and have the right perspective to see. Coupled with Robert's candid, empowering reflections on existence and his illness, the vision of the world revealed in <i>Healing Art </i>urges readers to live in the present, relax, and remember that life is good. </p><p>Despite the nature of our burdens, if we can focus on an image of beauty today, we have not let our challenges define us, Flatt writes and for another day, we have been fully alive and open to the presence of joy. Could we really ask for more? A powerful memoir on making the most of one's life, even in the face of a devastating chronic illness. </p>Robert Flatt earned his Bachelor of Arts and Masters of Science in electrical engineering from Rice University and his MBA from Harvard University. He spent thirty-one years in the oil service industry as an engineer and businessman before he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 1999.

What changes should be expected in this century? </p><p>This is the vast and fascinating question Jean-Louis Roy tries to answer with the help of correspondents from Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe in this look at diversity and the future of the world. The author argues that shifting wealth from the West to Asia, Latin America and Africa causes the reconfiguration of the economic map, and this tilting also transforms the global cultural space. The dominant cultural position occupied by the Atlantic area will not disappear overnight. However, it is important to note that emerging countries are working earnestly, well served by the tools of the digital age. For example, China is already the world leader in the art market, and Nigeria, the second in international film production after India. </p><p>A unique combination of cultural insight with political analysis, The Age of Diversity is a fascinating look at our ever-changing world, predicting cultural futures we would not normally expect to see, and all based on the evidence here in the 21st Century we live in. </p><p>Jean-Louis Roy is president of various cultural organizations, including the International Partnership and the Centre de la francophonie in the Americas, Jean-Louis Roy was director of Le Devoir from 1981 to 1986 before being appointed Québec's Delegate General in Paris, a post he held until 1990. from 1990 to 1998 he was Secretary General of the Agence de la Francophonie in Paris.

While they must perform in a VUCA world (one characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity), their ability to OODA (observe, orient, decide, and act) is no longer enough to survive and thrive amidst disorder! While agility is quintessential for adapting in this new reality, antifragility is quintessential for evolving in this new reality! Conclusively, business organizations must embrace this new reality and emerge stronger!

And yet, just being, or wanting to be creative is not enough—it is essential to train and develop this ability in order to achieve results. In other words, we need a guide to show us the way and provide us with the tools needed to progress. Designpedia is an essential manual for Design Thinking which brings together all the tools you need to achieve innovation and entrepreneurship goals and organized around four basic processes: mapping, exploring, building and testing. It also reveals how, as long as you use the right tools, you can create original and effective solutions. Includes case studies to show how this is working for big companies (Orange or BBVA) as well as startups (Dovase or Bydsea).Rafael Zaragoza is the co-founder and Creative Director of Thinkers Co. and has a background in industrial design.

He is currently a visiting professor at IE Business School.The Human WayThe Ten Commandments of New ManagementKelly Odell<p><span>In this counter-intuitive book for managers, the author argues that no one is perfect and that success as a leader is not about being perfect and always doing the right thing; it is about accepting your own humanity and adopting a number of down-to-earth attitudes and values. That's when we achieve true (adequate) success. Through ten commandments-starting with \"Be humble-as a manager, you are also an employee\"-management expert Kelly Odell provides a new perspective on how we should behave as managers in this age of differing cultures and values. How we think about people, motivation, power and relationships is the foundation for successful management. Odell argues that too much emphasis is placed on the leader setting a good example and becoming a (heroic) role model, when in fact a leader whose priority is on other people is more likely to create value for their company and succeed as a manager.</span><br></p><p><span>Kelly Odell is a leading expert and trainer in management, and works with some of Europe's largest companies.

The core premise of the book is geared around the idea that inspiring leaders are not only successful because of what they do. It is primarily because of who they are. A certain sense of being that comes with deeper levels of awareness, which turns ordinary people into inspiring leaders.
Whether you are a CEO, a director, a student, a parent, or merely someone who wants to inspire and make a positive difference in the world, reaching deeper levels of awareness is what will help you make that difference.Bahriye Goren is the co-founder of Art of Branding, a global branding consultancy, as well as a lecturing professor of Marketing and International business.

For example, sleep is now something we do in between checking our smartphones. Our relationship to food and eating has changed too. Home delivery, restaurant search, table bookings—these have all been elevated to a high level skill-set which is part-entertainment, part-electronic processing. And travel is now a finger-clicking exercise with precision timing. This readjustment of our daily routine has had one significant effect: it has taught individuals a range of skills that would normally be in the domain of businesses. Ordinary people now behave as businesses do by using buying strategies to get costs down. We now have expectations of quality and delivery. In fact, we have become so business-like as individuals that marketers need to get rid of the processes of "Business-to-Consumer" communication, and begin to adopt the rules of "Business-to-Business" when talking to consumers.

Illustrated by Carl DiRoccoTrouble's coming to the Wilder Family Campground. When Cooper and Packrat find their geocache box full of illegal eagle parts, their lazy summer is over.

MorganIn Book Two of The Five Stones Trilogy, Chase, determined to fulfill his promise to find the unifying Fifth Stone, finds the elusive Captain Nate and brings him back to the island of Ayda, where one realm is burning and two others are under siege from Dankar's dark forces of Exor. Meanwhile, Knox and Evelyn must trust a mysterious guide to help them find a way back, though each has their own personal struggle to overcome. All three children must decide if they can put their own needs—and fears—aside to save their friends and family.G. A. MORGAN is the author of The Fog of Forgetting and Chantarelle, the first two books in The Five Stones trilogy, and several nonfiction works under her full name, Genevieve Morgan.

MorganBook 1 of The Five Stones Trilogy: Sneaking out for a quick boat ride on a summer day, five children find themselves engulfed in a curtain of dense, powerful fog that transports them from the rocky Maine coast to the mysterious island of Ayda. Rescued by Seaborne, a machete-toting wayfarer of few words, the children suddenly find themselves at the center of a centuries-old battle between Dankar, the ruler of Exor, and three siblings that rule the other realms of Ayda. At stake are the four stones of power and the elusive Fifth Stone that binds them all. When 9-year-old Frankie is kidnapped by Dankar, her older sister Evelyn and the three Thompson brothers must learn to harness the powers of the daylights, ancient forces of earth, fire, water, and air, in order to navigate their way through the realms of Ayda, rescue her, and find a way home.G. A. MORGAN is the author of The Fog of Forgetting and Chantarelle, the first two books in The Five Stones trilogy, and several nonfiction works under her full name, Genevieve Morgan.

MorganIn the dramatic conclusion of The Five Stones Trilogy, Chase, Evelyn, and Knox must gather together disparate forces to save not just Ayda but their own world. The three young people have returned through the fog to fulfill their promise to the Keepers on the island of Ayda, whose four realms are in turmoil. But in Exor, Dankar's evil forces continue to grow as he corrupts and coerces all in his domain, with the final intent of gaining total control of Ayda so he may take his battle to the world beyond the fog—our world. The stones of power that fuel the other three realms—and their people—weaken as Dankar harnesses more energy.  Chase, Evelyn, and Knox—each one struggling in a different realm—are on a desperate quest to learn more about their own powers and halt what seems to be the inevitable destruction of Ayda. The dramatic reappearance of Chanterelle and two mysterious guests bring answers long sought, but not before everyone on Ayda has been tested to the utmost of their abilities and reunited in the most unexpected of ways. Now, only the Fifth Stone can restore harmony to Ayda and the fate of the world hangs in the balance. G.A. Morgan, who "excels at world-building," (School Library Journal), introduced us to Ayda in "The Fog of Forgetting" and raised the stakes in "Chantarelle." Now she brings the trilogy to a conclusion with a profound investigation of what it takes to continue believing in one another when almost every hope is gone.G. A.

It's a whole world where fantastical animals run, hide, swim, and frolic in a calico jungle. The boy enters this wild landscape and travels through it. He spies calico birds pecking at fruits, sees calico elephants giving each other shower baths, discovers spotted horses, striped lions, and calico fish shining like jewels. As he nears the far side of the quilt, the animals he encounters are curled up asleep. The boy grows sleepy, too. His eyes close and he dreams that he is walking through the calico jungle, under the flowering trees, where all the strange and wonderful animals lived. This marvelous book by renowned artist and illustrator Dahlov Ipcar will spark every child's imagination, inspire them to question what is real, and invite them to explore a world full of color and possibility.Dahlov Ipcar was born in Vermont, raised in Greenwich Village, and summered in Maine after her parents (the famed sculptor William Zorach and artist Marguerite Zorach) bought a farm on Georgetown Island in 1923.Thirteen years later, eighteen-year-old Dahlov, an aspiring artist, married Adoph Ipcar. The young couple left New York City in 1937 to live on the Maine farm where they first met. By the early 1940s, she had nearly given up thoughts of writing and illustrating books, but was contacted by a New York publisher to illustrate The Little Fisherman, the latest title by Margaret Wise Brown.

Illustrated by Kevin Barry, Kevin BarryOn some days, there's just not a good word for the way you are feeling. If your socks are sagging and your pants are wrinkled, what do you call it? Maybe you're feeling like a turtle. Maybe you're feeling halfway wild. Writer Laura Freudig has found a delightful new way to describe those feelings in this poetic and playful picture book that connects children, not just to feelings and emotions, but also to animals and the quirks and patterns of the natural world. We follow one family through the course of a day as they march through meadows like ants, dive to the depths like seals, play hide and seek like fireflies, and chatter like raccoons, until, at last, "… when the house is still and all we can hear are the soft, slow breaths of the ones we love, we're a family of bears." Illustrator Kevin Barry blends the real with the fantastic in works of art that will make young readers lean in for a closer look, marvel, and dream.Laura Freudig lives on an island along the Maine coast with her husband, five children, two ducks, fifteen chickens, one dog, and nine thousand honeybees. She likes reading, singing, hiking, and gardening.

At an early age, Kevin Barry began drawing crazy cats and martial artist monkeys on the backs (and corners) of his homework assignments, a habit he has yet to break. He was thrilled to put this wildlife sketching inclination to good use in illustrating "Halfway Wild." When not illustrating books for children, the award-winning children's book illustrator can be found either scratching out stories with elementary students; snout deep in a book; or exploring the wilds of New England with his Halfway Wild family.N is for New HampshireRebecca Rule

Illustrated by Delton Gerdes"Artie watched the trees. When they saw children misbehave, a fine mist flowed from their branches. When touched by this mist, children stopped bickering, babies stopped crying, and parents started smiling. "What's that coming from your branches?" asked Artie. "That's Christmas Spirit…" Artie is delighted when a family selects him to be their Christmas tree. But, because he's not a real tree, he doubts he has enough Christmas Spirit to bring the children the hope, joy, love and peace they need. Who can help Artie believe in himself? No one knows more about Christmas Spirit than Santa. That jolly old elf soon sets Artie straight. Any tree—just like any person—has an infinite amount of Christmas Spirit to share, if it comes from the heart.

Illustrated by James LittleSince he was a very little boy, Smitty's dream has been to play football, but his mom says school comes first. When his teacher says his excitement for the game is interfering with his work, he's got a big problem. Can Smitty make both his mom and his coach proud? Wade Smith's story, based on his own experience, shows young students and athletes how important it is to stay focused and determined at school so they can achieve their dreams in life and on the field.Wade Smith, NFL Veteran and Pro Bowler from Dallas, Texas, established The Wade Smith Foundation in 2012 to provide community support for youth programs throughout the DFW Metroplex and Greater Houston Areas. "It was an opportunity for me to give back to those people that helped me get where I am in life. I chose literacy and education as major focuses of the foundation because having that groundwork laid and putting emphasis on going to college and getting your degree leads you toward success and being able to do what you want in life."The ABCs of Yoga for KidsTeresa Anne Power

Star quarterback Quentin Barnes has led his beloved Ionath Krakens to glory on the gridiron and become the most-recognized individual in history, but it is off the field where his world crumbles around him. Over four seasons with Ionath, he's picked up powerful enemies: one of which drove his sister into the Portath Cloud, a place from which no ship returns.

Since the late 1800s, only 71 pitchers have been able to do it. Yet, unlike other rare achievements in baseball, such as pitching a perfect game, the "immaculate inning" does not capture the same attention or consideration. In a game that is as unpredictable as baseball, perfection, when it occurs, should be cause for both reflection and celebration.In Immaculate, Cairney provides a short history of perfect innings through the stories of the pitchers who pitched them. Beginning with an brief overview of the numbers, the remaining chapters, one for each immaculate inning on record in major baseball, provides insight into the men, their careers and details of the inning itself, from the first recorded perfect inning in 1889 to the most recent string of innings last MLB season in 2014. The names include pitching greats such as Jim Bunning, Sandy Koufax, Nolan Ryan and Randy Johnson, but also many lesser known, if not colorful, pitchers like "Sloppy" Thurston and Bill Wilson. The teams include famous franchises like the Detroit Tigers and the New York Yankees, but also clubs now defunct like the Boston Beaneaters and the Montreal Expos. Using immaculate innings as benchmarks, the book provides an engaging and entertaining journey through the history of professional baseball that will delight both the serious student of the game, as well as the fan who enjoys reading about the game.John Cairney is a Professor in the Departments of Family Medicine, Psychiatry and Behavioural Neurosciences, and Kinesiology at the McMaster University.

Is it possible that instead, book destruction can be turned into beautiful and inspiring works of art?</P>
<P>That's the premise behind a new book from distinguished designer and photographer, Julius Friedman. Titled simply, <I>The Book</I>, Friedman's latest project is an art book made possible by the sacrifice of several other beautiful books for the pieces within.</P>
<P>"<I>The Book </I>project was inspired by Gail Gilbert, the art librarian at the University of Louisville Library, when she gave me a bag of books she was discarding," Friedman noted. "She thought I could tear them up and make collages or an art project. I told her I was not a collage artist and, being a book designer, I could not tear them up. After months of them sitting in my basement and Gail saying, 'Do something with them,' I made my first deconstruction and collage," he added.</P>
<P>Those first collages grew into a body of work, and later, a limited edition of 20 books, all hand-sewn and hand-bound, using hand-set type, letterpress, and tipped-in photographs—and a box made of cherry wood to house each copy. The "run" sold out immediately. "After that project, I continued to make collages and decided to do a coffee table book that people from all walks of life could afford, enjoy, and experience," the artist added.</P>
<P>The result is stunning. In 130 beautiful photographs, Friedman gives his torn-apart and twisted books fascinating shapes and structures, some lit from within or without, ranging from the abstract to the concrete, and from the visceral to the intellectual. "I looked at the book from its beginnings to the current and emerging world of the Kindle and other electronic tablets, intuitively keeping in mind the sacred word, censorship, holding an object, its tactile way, even the smell of a book," he stated.</P>
<P><I>The Book</I> will be loved, ironically, by book lovers who will recognize how the artist has harnessed the tactile power of books and transformed them into new and moving forms for his art.</P><P>JULIUS FRIEDMAN is a graphic designer, photographer and artist specializing in cultural, nonprofit, and corporate design. His work is included in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York City; The National Gallery of Art, Washington DC; the National Museum of Poster Art, Warsaw, Poland; The Dansk Plakamuseum, Aarhous, Denmark; The Brown-Forman Corporation; 21C Museum; PNC Bank; and NTS Corporation.</P>

Today, the bar's interior design tends to individuation and diversification, which is directly related to creation intentions of the designer and the owner. A bar's theme could be anything or any events, even a fleeting idea. Therefore, now a bar's theme tends to be diversified and abstract which runs through every aspect of its interior design. This book will illustrate bar design in four chapters: theme design, layout design, the use of materials and lighting design. Each chapter starts with some must-know design points and then some experienced designers will share their experience with design cases. At last, some featured bar design cases within recent three years will be illustrated. The common features of our selected cases are promoted and highlighted: consideration of details, emphasis on experience and sustainability, understanding of owner's demands and appropriate expression of space.Architect Minas Kosmidis graduated from the School of Architecture of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1988 and in 1991 he completed his postgraduate studies in "Industrial Design" with a state scholarship from "EOMMEX," at the École d' Architecture de Paris-Conflans in the department of "Étude et Creation de Mobilier" in Paris, France.Minas Kosmidis [Architecture In Concept], establishes his first architectural studio in the town of Komotini in 1993, and his second in the town of Thessaloniki in 1998, with operations around Greece.

As a collection of Neo-classicism residences, this book showcases each projects with rich pictures and texts and explains their design concepts in detail. It is a great reference book for designers who love Neo-classicism.Marina Putilovskaya，one of the most popular and professional interior designers in Russia, became a designer in the late 1990s.Landscape LightingRoger NarboniLighting is a key feature of almost all interiors and exteriors, but it is often treated in a superficial manner in most design books. This book features more than 50 recent international projects where the lighting is the defining design feature. For large schemes, a professional lighting designer is usually employed, but for smaller projects it will often fall to the architect or designer to specify the lighting. In either case, it is crucial that the architect or designer understands what lighting is available, how it can be used and controlled and how it can be fitted. The projects featured in this book include road lighting, square & park lighting, architectural façade lighting, bridge lighting and furniture lighting schemes, each with detailed plans, diagrams, sketches to demonstrate the lighting techniques involved. Each project is also accompanied by an explanatory text that looked at the original brief, the design concept, and the detailed specification of light fittings.Roger Narboni, lighting designer, CONCEPTO Studio, FranceArchitectural Material & Detail StructureMasonryNils Van MerrienboerBrick and stone have been used in architecture for a long time and are favoured by architects due to their unique properties and characteristics.

Therefore, how to increase its public acceptance is architects' great consideration. Many architects have tried actively; some mix concrete and other materials in a proper proportion—clean concrete surface combined with carefully manufactured wood or metal makes it easier to be acceptable. The perfection and abstraction of concrete are also more influential to those who are familiar to contemporary art trend.Architect by ETSAB (Escuela Superior de Arquitectura de Barcelona) 1999, PFC presentation: "Auditorium, Music Conservatory and Foundation for Music in Girona," Grade:10, Distinction, Project selected to represent the ETSAB within the itinerant exhibition of PFC 1995-00, with others schools: Architectural Association School of Architecture, London; Princenton School of Architecture, New York; École Spéciale d'Architecture ESA, Paris; and Delft University of Technology, Netherlands, Professor since 1998, teaches in many different schools like: ETSAB;La Salle, Escuela de Ingeniería y Arquitectura, Barcelona, University of Illinois, Chicago (UIC), Instituto Europeo di Design (IED), and Escola de disseny i art (Eina), Also guest teacher for many schools like: Hochschule für Technik Zürich (HSZT), Escola da Cidade in Sao Paulo, Universidade Positivo (UNICENP) in Curitiba y Universidade Federal do Paraná (UFPR), His work has been exhibited in many countries, including: United States, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and Portugal.Architectural Material & Detail StructureAdvanced MaterialsEckhard GerberAdvanced materials refers to newly developed material with better performance than traditional materials.

Howard & Rita D. Sherma, Rita D Sherma<p>Dharma is central to all the indigenous religious traditions of India, which cannot adequately be understood apart from it. Often translated as 'ethics', 'religion' or 'religious law', <i>dharma</i> possesses elements of each of these but is not confined to any single category. Neither is it the equivalent of what many in the West might usually consider to be 'a philosophy'. </p><p>This much needed analysis of the history and heritage of dharma shows that it is instead a multi-faceted religious force, or paradigm, that has defined and that continues to shape South Asian civilization in a whole multitude of forms. Experts in the fields of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh studies here bring fresh insights to dharma in terms both of its distinctiveness and its commonality as these are expressed across, and between, the local religions of India. Exploring ethics, practice, history and social and gender issues, the contributors correct philosophical misrepresentations that are increasingly widespread in the West, and point to ways of appreciating Indian religions in a manner appropriate to the practice of Eastern, rather than Western, tradition.</p>Veena R Howard is Assistant Professor of Religious and Asian Studies at the University of Oregon and author of Gandhi's Ascetic Activism: Renunciation and Social Action (2014).Rita D Sherma is Swami Vivekenanda Visiting Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Southern California and editor (with Tracy Pintchman) of Woman and Goddess in Hinduism: Reinterpretations and Re-imaginings (2011) and (with Arvind Sharma) of Hermeneutics and Hindu Thought: Toward a Fusion of Horizons (2008).From Me to WeThe Changing WorkplaceMatthew DriscollThis is a surprising book which presents us the changing trend of work place with the emergence of big data. This may bring us more imaginations: in the future, should the employers trace their employees' movement in work places? Can the colour of an interior wall change the way that we think and perceive? Even do you need an actual office now? The answers may be varied. But we are sure that the design of work place is changing in the role of enhancing working efficiency. This book unfolds in accordance to this idea. We have to admit that with the development of age of big data, work places are changing from a spatial order of "I" to that of "We." Changes are constant and develop with social developments. We hope this book will trigger readers' deep thoughts.Matthew Driscoll co-founded Threefold Architects with Jack Hosea in 2004.

These values are introduced at an early age by our education system, and at work, we are assessed based on what we know, on having the answers and solutions. Our need for certainty, to know what's going on, to have all the answers, exerts strong pressure in our lives. This award-winning book offers an alternative, contrarian approach to dealing with such pressures—and to embrace "not knowing" rather than fearing it. The authors argue it is by "not knowing" that we in fact develop an exploratory mindset, and we discover, engage and create new ways to deal with business and management problems and issues. The book is supported by stories of individuals and the positive change they made in their lives through "not knowing." Solving new problems with old ways of thinking are no longer useful in the new world.Steven D'Souza is an Executive Fellow for IE Business School, a consultant and the author of the bestselling Brilliant Networking (Pearson).

But what if genius is available to all? In the 21st Century, when the world is faced with many problems, some of which have the capacity to destroy us, putting a cap on potential is not what is required. What is required is a new understanding of genius-one that boldly states that genius is within the reach, no, the grasp, of each and every one of us. An understanding of genius that enables our communities, be they social or business, to survive and thrive. Although there is a vast amount of research and science about the nature of high performance, the science is fragmented and only coheres in a number of somewhat 'siloe-ed' disciplines: psychology, biology, neuroscience, social science, sports psychology and so on. Enabling Genius is for people who wish to explore the outer reaches of their potential. This original and powerful book provides a broad collaborative view on the scientific research of performance and presents a model for enabling genius that is concise and scientifically valid.Myles Downey is a writer, speaker, consultant and innovator and is widely regarded as one of the leading business coaches in Europe. For more than 25 years, he has coached senior executives and leadership teams in some of the most prestigious organizations around the globe, enabling them to achieve extraordinary goals. In 1996, Myles founded The School of Coaching, and later, in 2015, The School of Coaching International to bring his coaching expertise in developing excellence to a wider global audience. He also created the fi rst and only online coaching system, Enable, which extends high quality coaching to all in a fl exible and aff ordable manner. His book, 'Effective Coaching', sold 300,000 copies and is considered a seminal work on coaching. This was followed by 'Effective Modern Coaching' in 2014. From 2013 to 2015, he led the international Enabling Genius Research Project, resulting in this book. The project continues to explore what it takes to make manifest excellence and genius.Ancient Iran Through Chinese RecordsBerthold Laufer, Brian Spooner<p>In this most important work, the pioneering anthropologist Berthold Laufer documents the cultural transfers that took place between China and Iran in early times, revealing much about both countries, but in particular Iran, since far less written records exist for that nation. </p><p>In addition, few other works provide so much informative detail about the way human activity has modified the natural world through the movement of plants and other natural resource products from one historical civilization to another.

How we think about people, motivation, power and relationships is the foundation for successful management.

It is through the arts that we have always explored our humanity: through dance and music; art and sculpture; theatre and poetry. The arts allow us to explore our own selves and our relationship to others and to the world around us. This central role of the arts is commonly accepted in everyday life, but the implications of this are not typically extended to the world of business.
The authors argue strongly that, to the contrary, the methodologies and approaches that are fundamental to performing artists of all kinds can provide exactly the kind of inspirational, people-centered and performance-related techniques that are missing from much of the typically mechanistic, systems-based and process-driven training and development of managers and executives. Technical proficiency and expertise are not enough to deliver an award-winning result; what enables a truly outstanding performance is the elusive but entirely recognizable element of artistry—the spark that transforms a technically good performance into something extraordinary.Jonathan Gifford is a business coach and writer.<BR><BR>Dr. Mark Powell is a Partner at leading management consultancy firm AT Kearney.IconicHow to Create and Maintain the Momentum of SuccessXavier Bekaret, Gillis Jonk, Jan Raes & Phebo Wibbens<p><span>This book is about icons-exceptional organizations (orchestras, restaurants, sports teams or companies) with an aspiration to make or do something special, and to go on doing so, year in, year out for decades. This is what gives these organizations their undeniably iconic status. By selecting 14 iconic organizations (including ElBulli, McKinsey, Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Procter & Gamble, the All Blacks) and researching what characteristics make them different from others, the authors discovered a "competency spiral" which these organizations exhibit in their success. Attracting and retaining the right people; forging individuals into a team; and achieving outstanding results, time after time, through continuous improvement and adjustment-these are the key competencies required to achieve iconic status.</span><br></p><p><span>Xavier Bekaert specializes in Management Consulting in strategy, organization and transformation, concentrating on financial institutions and consumer industries, having previously worked with AT Kearney and Bain & Company.

A customer-driven organization maintains a base of loyal customers by recognizing that customer service and product quality are fundamental to maintaining a competitive advantage. These organizations have incredibly strong, inspirational and charismatic leaders with strong culture and behavioural norms or even rules that guide everyone how to function within the organization. They think that their way is the only way! This book explains how the environment and culture created in some of the world's greatest customer-focused companies resembles the mindset created by a cult. It is by understanding the "anatomy" of such companies that we, too, can embark upon a journey of customer excellence within our companies.Oke Eleazu, is the Managing Director of the consulting company, Think Outside In.

Digging ever deeper, we fail to pause to scan the skies or peer over the ridge of the trench. We lose context and our connection to the surrounding region breaks down. We construct our own localised, closed system. Until entropy inevitably has its way. Our system then fails, our specialism suddenly rendered redundant. The expertise we valued so highly has served to narrow and shorten our vision. It has blinded us to potential and opportunity. This book argues that there is the need and place for both specialist and the generalist. Currently, it feels the balance is tipped too far towards specialism, which results in too much blinkered decision-making. The authors call for people to develop into generalists. These are people who possess both a breadth and depth of skills, knowledge and experience. These are most definitely not jack of all trades, masters of none. Rather, they are people who have the potential, the attitude and the aptitude to specialise in more than one discipline, and are adept at navigating the digital, networked world we inhabit today.</span><br></p><p><span>Richard Martin is the author of Mean Streets and Raging Bulls, about the evolution of film noir in the context of industrial, social and cultural change.

Or so we are told. Headlines blast messages about clashes between tribes, civilizations, political factions, East and West. We are told that unless we abstain from eating meat, flying or enjoying other modern amenities, the planet is doomed. We live in times of trouble. Of crossroads. Of signs of decline. We live in special times. In turn, future thinking is often reduced to people having opinions about other people's opinions. As opposed to manifesto, in manifesto many small ideas are created to inspire one person, your-self. By sharing the vision of the future, we can avoid telling stories and instead strive to surround ourselves with as many strange, conflicting ideas that we can in order to immerse ourselves in future possibilities and possible futures. Incorporating recognizable examples, 'Minifesto' will illustrate how the world changes when a single individual does something new.Magnus Lindkvist is an international futurist and consultant. He is the author of 'Everything We Know' and 'When the Future Begins'.BeBahriye  Goren-GulekWhat is it about certain individuals that inspire not only themselves but also the people around them, organizations, and even whole nations to be more creative, innovative and transformational?
The core premise of the book is geared around the idea that inspiring leaders are not only successful because of what they do. It is primarily because of who they are. A certain sense of being that comes with deeper levels of awareness, which turns ordinary people into inspiring leaders.
Whether you are a CEO, a director, a student, a parent, or merely someone who wants to inspire and make a positive difference in the world, reaching deeper levels of awareness is what will help you make that difference.Bahriye Goren is the co-founder of Art of Branding, a global branding consultancy, as well as a lecturing professor of Marketing and International business.

Hyttffors draws from the idea of yogic philosophy and the concept of mind mastery to help managers address the future of rapid change. He weaves together cutting edge technology with ancient Indian philosophy to increase business leaders' understanding of how everything is becoming interconnected, and how current problems on a macro level and disruptive technologies (as solutions) will change the world.

For example, sleep is now something we do in between checking our smartphones. Our relationship to food and eating has changed too. Home delivery, restaurant search, table bookings—these have all been elevated to a high level skill-set which is part-entertainment, part-electronic processing. And travel is now a finger-clicking exercise with precision timing. This readjustment of our daily routine has had one significant effect: it has taught individuals a range of skills that would normally be in the domain of businesses. Ordinary people now behave as businesses do by using buying strategies to get costs down. We now have expectations of quality and delivery. In fact, we have become so business-like as individuals that marketers need to get rid of the processes of "Business-to-Consumer" communication, and begin to adopt the rules of "Business-to-Business" when talking to consumers. Such change of our lives is an explosion of the new—new thinking, new business, new relationships, new selling, new buying, new leisure, new humans.Andy Law is one of the world's most respected and radical thinkers and practitioners in marketing and business. He is the author of Open Mind and Implosion.Adaptive CapacityHow Organizations Can Thrive in a Changing WorldJuan Carlos EichholzIn today's business world, change of many kinds—technological, economic, social, and environmental—is outpacing the ability of organizations to predict it and manage it.

In the meantime, their creative workloads are growing, driven by increased TV, digital and social advertising. How do agencies generate profit margins under these circumstances? Through downsizing, salary freezes and 'juniorizing.' Agencies are disinvesting in capabilities at a time when their clients' marketing challenges have never been greater. No wonder their clients are beefing up their internal capabilities and changing agencies at an accelerated rate! <BR>This is Madison Avenue Manslaughter, documented in detail by Michael Farmer, who has been working in the industry for the past 25 years. Farmer, who was formerly a Director of Bain & Company, provides a gripping analysis of advertising agencies and their deteriorating situation.

Self-confessed environmental capitalist Carl Hall argues that we need changes on a large scale and the only system that can reliably deliver that is capitalism. A bad conscience or wanting to be "green" will never create scale. People will continue to say they want an environmental solution and then still pick the cheapest goods in the supermarket. We need to turn to self-interest and the invisible hand. Treating environmental questions as something that can be solved by appealing to people's good nature is a red herring. In this controversial but inspiring book, Hall argues that capitalism is a system that can optimize anything we tell it to optimize, be it the most efficient refinery or the lowest-cost windmill. For companies that are serious about addressing the challenges the world is facing, there are great opportunities to turn bold actions into profits. As Hall says, "Sustainability is the biggest business opportunity in the history of the world!"</P><P>Carl Hall is an entrepreneur and the founder of Alder, a private equity fund focused on growth companies in the clean technology industry.</P>Peter Drucker’s Consulting PrinciplesAnd How to Apply Them for Business SuccessWilliam A.

Since then, there has been a major seismatic shift in the entire email marketing industry. The standard approach to email marketing<QUOTE>"<QUOTE>batch and blast<QUOTE>-- is serious trouble. It simply no longer performs. Subscriber inboxes are overflowing with irrelevant permission-based emails that only annoy. Research shows that 60% of subscribers simply ignore the emails. There are two basic ways to approach email marketing today. First is the traditional way<QUOTE>"<QUOTE>fishing<QUOTE>: massive numbers of identical emails<QUOTE>"and dozens of campaigns handled the same way--are sent to relatively unknown subscribers<QUOTE>¦and analyzed by opens, clicks, conversions, and unsubscribes. Second is <QUOTE>farming<QUOTE>: personalized, relevant email communications to individual subscribers based on a database of demographic and behavioral information. It is possible today to send a different promotional email to every single customer tailored to customer's preferences, behavior and lifestyle. Furthermore, marketing emails can be interactive. This book goes deeply into the entire business of email marketing based on farming of subscribers. It covers triggered messages, interactivity, retention and loyalty building, relevance, lifetime value, segmentation, viral marketing and testing. It shows how you can combine offline and online purchasing history into a single database to create a 360-degree picture of each individual subscriber in order to speak to him or her with personal knowledge. The methods present here are both very old and very new. Email marketing based on farming brings to today's electronic age marketing methods that worked when the world was much smaller, and personal loyalty was important in marketing. Email marketing based on farming makes it possible to build and maintain one-on-one relationships with thousands of customers that create bonds of loyalty that keep customers buying for a lifetime. This book shows how to do it profitably.Arthur Middleton Hughes is one of the acknowledged pioneers of data base marketing with more than twenty-nine years of experience designing and building marketing databases for more than thirty companies, including wireless and wired Telecoms, banks, insurance companies, retailers, automobile, and Internet companies.

Mao Zedong was the leader of a revolution, a communist who lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, an aggressive and distrustful leader, and a man responsible for more civilian deaths than perhaps any other historical figure. </p><p>Now, four decades after Mao's death, acclaimed biographer Philip Short presents a fully updated and revised edition of his ground-breaking and masterly biography of Chairman Mao. Vivid, uncompromising and unflinching, Short presents in one-volume the man behind the propaganda—his family, his beliefs and his horrors. In doing so he shows us both the human being Mao was, and the monster he became. With extensive notes and photos. </p><p>"In an epic biography, Short draws on a wealth of hitherto untapped sources to fashion an uncanny portrait of Mao Zedong… Short's dramatic biography will reward readers with its fresh perspectives on China's civil war, Mao's treacherous relations with Stalin, party infighting and the power struggle following Mao's death. It not only sheds valuable light on Mao's character but also serves as an illuminating and sweeping history of modern China." –<i> Publishers Weekly</i><br></p><p>Philip Short was for thirty years a foreign correspondent for the BBC, based in Washington, Moscow, Paris, Tokyo and Beijing.

Why? How was art produced to control and co-opt the peripheries of the Soviet Union, particularly Central Asia? Presenting the 'untold story' of Soviet Orientalism, Aliya Abykayeva-Tiesenhausen re-evaluates the imperial project of the Soviet state, placing the Orientalist undercurrent found within art and propaganda production in the USSR alongside the creation of new art forms in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. </p><p>From the turmoil of the 1930s through to the post-Stalinist era, the author draws on meticulous new research and rich illustrations to examine the political and social structures in the Soviet Union—and particularly Soviet Central Asia—to establish vital connections between Socialist Realist visual art, the creation of Soviet identity and later nationalist sentiments.</p>Aliya Abykayeva-Tiesenhausen is an art historian specializing in twentieth-century and contemporary Central Asian art. She holds a PhD from the Courtauld Institute of Art.The History of Central Asia, Volume 3The Age of Islam and the MongolsCristoph Baumer<p>Between the ninth and the fifteenth centuries, Central Asia was a major political, economic and cultural hub on the Eurasian continent. In the first half of the thirteenth century it was also the pre-eminent centre of power in the largest land-based empire the world has ever seen. This third volume of Christoph Baumer's extensively praised and lavishly illustrated new history of the region is above all a story of invasion, when tumultuous and often brutal conquest profoundly shaped the later history of the globe. </p><p>The author explores the rise of Islam and the remarkable victories of the Arab armies which—inspired by their vital, austere and egalitarian desert faith—established important new dynasties like the Seljuks, Karakhanids and Ghaznavids. A golden age of artistic, literary and scientific innovation came to a sudden end when, between 1219 and 1260, Genghiz Khan and his successors overran the Chorasmian-Abbasid lands. Dr Baumer shows that the Mongol conquests, while shattering to their enemies, nevertheless resulted in much greater mercantile and cultural contact between Central Asia and Western Europe.</p>Christoph Baumer—a leading explorer and historian of Central Asia, Tibet and China—has written several well-received books in the fields of history, religion, archaeology and travel. These include <i>The Church of the East: An Illustrated History of Assyrian Christianity</i>, <i>Traces in the Desert: Journeys of Discovery across Central Asia</i> and <i>China's Holy Mountain: An Illustrated Journey into the Heart of Buddhism</i>, all published by I.B.Tauris. His magisterial four-volume study of Central Asia began in 2012 with volume 1, T<i>he History of Central Asia: The Age of the Steppe</i> <i>Warriors</i>, and continued in 2014 with volume 2, <i>The Age of the Silk Roads</i>. The final volume will publish in 2018.MormonismAn IntroductionMalise Ruthven<p>Mormonism is often viewed as the quintessential American faith. Indeed, "they teach the American religion" was how Tolstoy once responded to a question about the Mormons. Mormonism was the first and most successful new religion to appear in the New World where, despite the Biblical language of its narrative, it created a novel and dynamic theology that was vitally different from the Protestant Christianity from which it originated. Today the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS) is one of the wealthiest and most powerful institutions in the USA. Its clean-cut, youthful missionaries appear as representative of American values as the executives of Citibank and comparable US institutions. </p><p>Yet at the heart of the Mormon story is a remarkable paradox. Despite their present-day image as 'archetypal Yankees', Mormons were long perceived as 'un-American' in their utopian socialism and in the hard battle they fought—and eventually lost—to preserve the sacred principle of polygamy, or 'plural marriage'. </p><p>In his lively and timely reappraisal of its apparent contradictions, Malise Ruthven discusses the emergence of Mormonism as a world religion; its theology, structure and rituals; the career of the Saints' charismatic founder, Joseph Smith, culminating in his assassination in 1844; the theocratic rule of Smith's successor, Brigham Young; the 1890 'Manifesto', when polygamy was abandoned in exchange for Utah statehood; the emergence of a Mormon Diaspora after World War 1; and the impressive growth of Mormonism outside the old American West after World War 2.</p>Malise Ruthven, described by the <i>Guardian </i>as "one of today's most perceptive observers and historians of religion," is internationally recognized for his work on Muslim thought and theology, fundamentalism, Mormonism, the social impact of religion and migration and the nexus between contemporary politics and belief. He is the author of <i>Islam: A Very Short Introduction</i>, <i>A Fury for God: The Islamist Attack on America </i>and <i>A Satanic Affair: Salman Rushdie and the Wrath of Islam</i>.BuddhismAn IntroductionAlexander Wynne<DIV>Buddhism is often characterised as one of the most complex and enigmatic of all the world&#39;s religions. Although the Buddha himself was not a philosopher in the sense that that term is often understood, a Buddhist philosophy nevertheless emerged from the Buddha&#39;s teachings that was astonishingly rich, profound and elusive. Buddhism, which for six millennia has been an integral part of South and East Asian society and civilization, is now increasingly popular in the West, where its teachings about liberation of the self from the cycle of existence have proved attractive to people from a wide variety of backgrounds. In this new and comprehensive textbook, Alexander Wynne shows that the story of Buddhism as a global system of belief begins with the life of the Buddha in northern India in the fifth century BCE. He discusses the many new advances that have been made in recent years with regard to Buddhist origins, and traces the ways that formative Indian doctrines helped shape the features of later Asian Buddhism. Carefully outlining the major Buddhist traditions, Wynne examines in turn the major Mahayana traditions of China, including the Ch&#39;an and Pure Land schools, as well as recent trends in Theravada Buddhism, especially in Sri Lanka and Thailand, and the Tantric Buddhism of Tibet. Finally, he turns to the role of Buddhism in the modern world, and explores how the western encounter with Buddhism has both affected and been affected it, especially in the fields of cognitive science and modern psychology.</p></div><DIV>Alexander Wynne, a former student of Richard Gombrich, is currently Lecturer in Buddhist Studies at Mahidol University, Thailand, and a translator for the prestigious Clay Sanskrit Library. He is the author of two previous books: <I>The Origin of Buddhist Meditation</I> (2007), and <I>The Book of Liberation I: A New Edition and Translation of the Moksa Section of the Mahabharata's Santiparvan</I> (2009, forthcoming).</div>IslamAn IntroductionCatharina Raudvere<DIV>Many existing introductions to Islam focus predominantly on the Middle East and on historical background at the expense of Islam as a lived faith. Assessing Islam as a truly global phenomenon, Catharina Raudvere engages thoroughly with history (explaining the significance of the revelation of the Prophet Muhammad and the origins of the different Sunni and Shi'a groups within Islam), while also giving full and comprehensive coverage to Muslim ritual life and Islamic ethics. She discusses moral debates and modern lifestyle issues such as halal consumption, interfaith dialogue and controversy over the wearing of the veil. Diaspora communities are considered with a view to showing how norms and doctrines are understood - and sometimes contradicted - in social and ritual practice. In addition, the author focuses on the meaning and continuing application to modern life of the Quran and hadith as sources for Islamic theology (kalam) and jurisprudence (fiqh). The book gives much attention to questions of universal values, Islam and democracy, gender issues, women's rights and pluralism, contrasting the thinking of Wahabism and radical Islamism with liberal reformist voices within Islam. Islam: An Introduction offers undergraduate students of religion and general readers a balanced, sensitive and well informed appraisal of the world's most intensively discussed religious and cultural traditions.</p></div><DIV>Catharina Raudvere is Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Copenhagen. Her previous books include The Book and the Roses: Sufi Women, Visibility and Zikir in Contemporary Istanbul (I.B.Tauris, 2003) and Sufism Today: Heritage and Tradition in the Global Community (I.B.Tauris, 2008, co-edited with Leif Stenberg). </p></div>ChristianityAn IntroductionPhilip Kennedy<DIV><P>The Christian faith has the allegiance of one third of the human race. It has succeeded in influencing civilization to such a degree that we now take its existence almost for granted. Yet it might all have been so different. Christianity began with the words and deeds of an obscure village carpenter's son who died a shameful criminal's death at the hands of the Roman occupiers of his country: itself an insignificant outpost of the powerful ruling Empire. The feverish land of biblical Palestine, awash with apocalyptic expectations of deliverance from its foreign overlords, was hardly short of seers and prophets who claimed to be sent visions from God. Yet the followers of this man thought he was different: so different, in fact, that some years after his death and asserted resurrection they scandalously insisted not only that he was sent by God, but that he ""was"" God. How a provincial sect, with its seemingly outrageous ideas, became first the sanctioned religion of the Roman Empire and then, over the course of 2000 years, the creed of billions of people, is the improbable story that this book tells. It is a story of freethinkers, friars, fanatics, and firebrands; and of the lay people (not just the clerical or the powerful) who have made up the great mass of Christians over the centuries. Many introductions to Christianity are written by Christians, for Christians. This elegant textbook, by contrast, shows that the history of the religion, while often glorious, is not one of unimpeded progress, but something still more remarkable, flawed and human.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Philip Kennedy teaches theology in the University of Oxford, where he is a Senior Research Fellow at Mansfield College. He is the author of a volume on Edward Schillebeeckx (1993), and also of <I>A Modern Introduction to Theology: New Questions for Old Beliefs</I> (2006) and <I>Twentieth Century Theologians: A New Introduction to Modern Christian Thought </I>(2009), both published by I.B.Tauris.</P></DIV>SikhismAn IntroductionNikky-Guninder Kaur Singh<DIV><P>Almost from the moment, some five centuries ago, that their religion was founded in the Punjab by Guru Nanak, Sikhs have enjoyed a distinctive identity. This sense of difference, forged during Sikhism's fierce struggles with the Mughal Empire, is still symbolised by the ""Five Ks"" (""panj kakar,"" in Punjabi), those articles of faith to which all baptised Sikhs subscribe: uncut hair bound in a turban; comb; special undergarment; iron bracelet and dagger (or kirpan) -- the unique marks of the Sikh military fraternity (the word Sikh means ""disciple"" in Punjabi). Yet for all its ongoing attachment to the religious symbols that have helped set it apart from neighboring faiths in South Asia, Sikhism amounts to far more than just signs or externals. Now the world's fifth largest religion, with a significant diaspora especially in Britain and North America, this remarkable monotheistic tradition commands the allegiance of 25 million people, and is a global phenomenon. In her balanced appraisal, Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh reviews the history, theology and worship of a community poised between reconciling its hereditary creeds and certainties with the fast-paced pressures of modernity. She outlines and explains the core Sikh beliefs, and explores the writings and teachings of the Ten Sikh Gurus in Sikhism's Holy Scriptures, the Sri Guru Granth Sahib (more usually called just the ""Granth""). Further chapters explore Sikh ethics, art and architecture, and matters of gender and the place of women in the tradition. The book attractively combines the warm empathy of a Sikh with the objective insights and acute perspectives of a prominent scholar of religion.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Nikky-Guninder Kaur Singh is Crawford Professor of Religious Studies at Colby College, Waterville, Maine, and Co-Chair of the Sikh Studies Section of the American Academy of Religion.

Littlejohn<DIV><P>It is arguably Confucianism, not Communism, which lies at the core of China's deepest sense of self. Although reviled by Chinese intellectuals of the 1950s-1990s, who spoke of it as ""yellow silt clotting the arteries of the country,"" Confucianism has defied eradication, remaining a fundamental part of the nation's soul for 2500 years. And now, as China assumes greater ascendancy on the world economic stage, it is making a strong comeback as a pragmatic philosophy of personal as well as corporate transformation, popular in both home and boardroom. What is this complex system of ideology that stems from the teachings of a remarkable man called Confucius (Kongzi), who lived in the distant sixth century BCE? Though he left no writings of his own, the oral teachings recorded by the founder's disciples in the <I>Analects</I> left a profound mark on later Chinese politics and governance. They outline a system of social cohesiveness dependent upon personal virtue and self-control. For Confucius, society's harmony relied upon the appropriate behaviour of each individual within the social hierarchy; and its emphasis on practical ethics has led many to think of Confucianism as a secular philosophy rather than a religion. In this new, comprehensive introduction, Ronnie Littlejohn argues rather that Confucianism is profoundly spiritual, and must be treated as such. He offers full coverage of the tradition's sometimes neglected metaphysics, as well as its varied manifestations in education, art, literature and culture.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Ronnie L.

It is the story of how a small cluster of desert tribes gave birth to a monotheistic doctrine that profoundly shaped the history of human civilization. It is the story of how that initially obscure desert doctrine came to be codified into the Hebrew Bible, one of the world's greatest works of literature. It is the story of how a small minority came to be viewed by the majority as disproportionately powerful and, following pogrom and Holocaust, were driven to the edge of extinction. And it is the story of how a displaced people, globally dispersed throughout other nations for two-and-a-half millennia, came to forge a modern, secular Israeli state which many Jews believe to have been granted an explicitly divine mandate. Oliver Leaman carefully and creatively explores the nature of these apparent contradictions. He discusses the origins of the Jewish Bible; recounts the history of the Jewish people from the era of Patriarchs and Prophets through the Middle Ages up to the contemporary era; outlines the Jewish liturgical calendar and its major rites and modes of worship; and considers the great variety of Jewish literatures (including modern post-Holocaust writers like Primo Levi and Elie Wiesel), art, food and culture. Further chapters examine such topics as mysticism and kabbalah; modern Hebrew; interfaith relations; and the highly contested question, ""Who is a Jew?"".</P></DIV><DIV><DIV><P>Oliver Leaman is Professor of Philosophy and Zantker Professor of Judaic Studies at the University of Kentucky.

Long<DIV><P>Jainism evokes images of monks wearing face-masks to protect insects and mico-organisms from being inhaled. Or of Jains sweeping the ground in front of them to ensure that living creatures are not inadvertently crushed: a practice of non-violence so radical as to defy easy comprehension. Yet for all its apparent exoticism, Jainism is still little understood in the West. What is this mysterious philosophy which originated in the 6th century BCE, whose absolute requirement is vegetarianism, and which now commands a following of four million adherents both in its native India and diaspora communities across the globe? In his welcome new treatment of the Jain religion, Long makes an ancient tradition fully intelligible to the modern reader. Plunging back more than two and a half millennia, to the plains of northern India and the life of a prince who--much like the Buddha--gave up a life of luxury to pursue enlightenment, Long traces the history of the Jain community from founding sage Mahavira to the present day. He explores asceticism, worship, the life of the Jain layperson, relations between Jainism and other Indic traditions, the Jain philosophy of relativity, and the implications of Jain ideals for the contemporary world. The book presents Jainism in a way that is authentic and engaging to specialists and non-specialists alike.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Jeffery D.

In present-day Iran, significant communities of Zoroastrians (who take their name from the founder of the faith, the remarkable religious reformer Zoraoster) still practice the rituals and teach the moral precepts that once undergirded the officially state-sanctioned faith of the mighty Sasanian empire. Beyond Iran, the Zoroastrian disapora is significant especially in India, where the Gujurati-speaking community of exiles from post-Sasanian Iran call themselves ""Parsis."" But there are also significant Zoroastrian communities to be found elsewhere, such as in the USA, Britain, and Canada, where western cultural contexts have shaped the religion in intriguing ways and directions. This new, thorough and wide-ranging introduction will appeal to anyone interested in discovering more about the faith that bequeathed the contrasting words ""Magi"" and ""magic,"" and whose adherents still live according to the code of ""Good Thoughts, Good Words, Good Deeds."" The central Zoroastrian concept that human beings are continually faced with a choice between the path of ""good"" and ""evil,"" represented by the contrasting figures of Ahura Mazda and Ahriman, inspired thinkers as diverse as Voltaire, Mozart, and Nietzsche. Jenny Rose shows why Zoroastrianism remains one of the world's most inspiring and perennially fascinating systems of ethics and belief.</DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV>Jenny Rose is Associate Professor of Religion at Claremont Graduate University and Visiting Associate Professor of Religion at Stanford University.

Littlejohn<DIV><P>""The way that can be told is not the eternal Way; the name that can be named is not the eternal Name."" So begins the first verse of the mysterious <I>Dao De Jing</I>, foundation text of the ancient Chinese religion of Daoism. Often attributed to semi-mythical sage Laozi, the origins of this enigmatic document--which probably came into being in the third century BCE--are actually unknown. But the tenets of Daoism laid down in the <I>Dao De Jing</I>, and in later texts like the <I>Yi Jing</I> (or <I>Book of Changes</I>), continue to exert considerable fascination, particularly in the West, where in recent years they have been popularized by writers such as the novelist Ursula K LeGuin. In this fresh and engaging introduction to Daoism, Ronnie L. Littlejohn discusses the central facets of a tradition which can sometimes seem as elusive as the slippery notion of ""Dao"" itself. The author shows that fundamental to Daoism is the notion of ""Wu-wei,"" or non-action: a paradoxical idea emphasising alignment of the self with the harmony of the universe, a universe in continual flux and change. This flux is expressed by the famous symbol of Dao, the ""taiji"" representing yin and yang eternally correlating in the form of a harmonious circle. Exploring the great subtleties of this ancient religion, Littlejohn traces its development and encounters with Buddhism, its expression in art and literature, its fight for survival during the Cultural Revolution, and its manifestations in modern-day China and beyond.</P></DIV><DIV><P><B>Ronnie L.

Do Hindus worship one god, or many? Is caste essential to religious practice? If Hindus are vegetarian, why does animal sacrifice continue to form part of their ritual? And is Hinduism even one religion at all, or is it better thought of as an interrelated matrix of connecting but ultimately separate beliefs? The notorious diversity which makes the religion so fascinating to outsiders can also make it difficult to understand. Will Sweetman's nuanced and carefully structured introductory text helps unravel the complex strands of one of the world's remarkable systems of belief, identifying the chief ingredients of Hinduism's rich and distinctive flavour. Offering a broadly thematic and historical overview of the multiplicity of religious thought and practice that in his view may uniformly be called 'Hindu', the author explores the theological and philosophical abundance of the Vedas, Upanishads and Mahabharata (including the intense theistic devotion—'bhakti'—of the Bhagavad-Gita). He then discusses the major Hindu gods; divine iconography and mythology; and the nature of temple worship, focusing above all on the ritual life of contemporary Hindus. Further chapters discuss the controversial Hindu caste system; the status of women within the tradition; and the various ways in which Hinduism has been challenged by the modern world, especially through the combined forces of colonialism, diaspora and globalization.Will Sweetman is Senior Lecturer in Asian Religions at the University of Otago. He is the author of two previous books: 'Mapping Hinduism: 'Hinduism' and the Study of Indian Religions, 1600-1776' (2003) and 'A Discovery of the Banian Religion and the Religion of the Persees' (1999).Chinese PhilosophyA New IntroductionRonnie L. Littlejohn<p>The philosophical traditions of China have arguably influenced more human beings than any other. China has been the home not only of its indigenous philosophical traditions of Confucianism and Daoism, but also of uniquely modified forms of Buddhism. <span>As Ronnie L Littlejohn shows in this dynamic and highly readable introduction, these traditions have for thousands of years formed the bedrock of the longest continuing civilization on the planet; and Chinese philosophy has profoundly shaped the institutions, social practices and psychological character of East and Southeast Asia. </span></p><p><span>The author surveys the key texts and philosophical systems of Chinese thinkers in a completely original and illuminating way. Ranging from the Han dynasty to the present, he discusses the six classical schools of Chinese philosophy (Yin-Yang, Ru, Mo, Ming, Fa and Dao-De); the arrival of Buddhism in China and its distinctive development; the central figures and movements from the end of the Tang dynasty to the introduction into China of Western thought; and the impact of Chinese philosophers—ranging from Confucius and Laozi to Tu Weiming—on their equivalents in the West.</span></p>Ronnie L Littlejohn is Professor of Philosophy and Director of Asian Studies at Belmont University, Tennessee.

Howard & Rita D. Sherma, Rita D Sherma<p>Dharma is central to all the indigenous religious traditions of India, which cannot adequately be understood apart from it. Often translated as 'ethics', 'religion' or 'religious law', <i>dharma</i> possesses elements of each of these but is not confined to any single category. Neither is it the equivalent of what many in the West might usually consider to be 'a philosophy'. </p><p>This much needed analysis of the history and heritage of dharma shows that it is instead a multi-faceted religious force, or paradigm, that has defined and that continues to shape South Asian civilization in a whole multitude of forms. Experts in the fields of Hindu, Buddhist, Jain and Sikh studies here bring fresh insights to dharma in terms both of its distinctiveness and its commonality as these are expressed across, and between, the local religions of India. Exploring ethics, practice, history and social and gender issues, the contributors correct philosophical misrepresentations that are increasingly widespread in the West, and point to ways of appreciating Indian religions in a manner appropriate to the practice of Eastern, rather than Western, tradition.</p>Veena R Howard is Assistant Professor of Religious and Asian Studies at the University of Oregon and author of Gandhi's Ascetic Activism: Renunciation and Social Action (2014).Rita D Sherma is Swami Vivekenanda Visiting Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Southern California and editor (with Tracy Pintchman) of Woman and Goddess in Hinduism: Reinterpretations and Re-imaginings (2011) and (with Arvind Sharma) of Hermeneutics and Hindu Thought: Toward a Fusion of Horizons (2008).Cultural Revolution in IranContemporary Popular Culture in the Islamic RepublicAnnabelle Sreberny & Massoumeh Torfeh, Massoumeh Torfeh<p>The Islamic Republic of Iran has entered its fourth decade, and the values and legacy of the Revolution it was founded upon continue to have profound and contradictory consequences for Iranian life.

In this book, Penelope Kinch analyses the extent to which political identity has contributed to challenges in the relationship and the role of myths in foreign policy. Kinch first examines the construction of political identity in each country, and thereby traces the imagined norms which have their impact on international behaviour. Looking at the misperceptions that have precluded closer communication between the two states, Kinch examines both historical issues, such as the 1979 US embassy hostage crisis as well as more contemporary crises, most notably over Iran's nuclear power programme.Penelope Kinch holds a PhD in International Relations from the Centre for Arab and Islamic Studies at the Australian National University. She is currently working as a risk management advisor for an international NGO.The US, the UK and Saudi Arabia in World War IIThe Middle East and the Origins of a Special RelationshipMatthew Fallon HindsThe story of Anglo-American relations in Saudi Arabia during the Second World War has generally been viewed as one of discord and hegemonic rivalry, a perspective reinforced by a tendency to consider Britain's decline and the ascent of US power as inevitable. In this engaging and timely study, Matthew Hinds calls into question such assumptions and reveals a relationship that, though hard-nosed, functioned through interdependence and strategic parity. Drawing upon an array of archives from both sides of the Atlantic, Hinds traces the flow of key events and policies as well as the leading figures who shaped events to show why, how and to what extent the allies and Saudi Arabia became 'mixed up together', in the words of Winston Churchill. Perhaps most fundamentally, Britain and the United States were enthralled by the promise of Saudi Arabia serving as an auxiliary to Allied strategy. Obtaining King Ibn Saud's tacit support or more specifically, his 'benevolent neutrality', meant having vital access, not only to the country's prospective oil reserves, but to its prized geographic location, its centrality within Islam and, as international politics increasingly followed an anti-colonial path, to its credentials as a sovereign and independent Arab state. Given what was at stake, London and Washington saw their engagement in Saudi Arabia as seminal; a genuine blueprint for how to forge a lasting 'Special Relationship' throughout the Middle East. Hinds' bold new interpretation is a vital work that enlarges our understanding of the Anglo-American wartime alliance.Matthew Fallon Hinds obtained his PhD, which examined Anglo-American relations in Saudi Arabia between the years of 1941 and 1945, from the London School of Economics. He received his MA degree with distinction in the History of International Relations from the LSE's Department of International History and graduated cum laude at the Catholic University of America with a BA degree in Politics. He was later an LSE Fellow, lecturing on international history, and has also been a visiting scholar at George Washington University in Washington DC and at the Graduate Institute in Geneva, Switzerland.Saudi Arabia & IranPower and Rivalry in the Middle EastSimon MabonIn the wake of the 1979 Iranian revolution, relations between states in the Middle East were reconfigured and reassessed overnight. Amongst the most-affected was the relationship between Iran and Saudi Arabia. The existence of a new regime in Tehran led to increasingly vitriolic confrontations between these two states, often manifesting themselves in the conflicts across the region, such as those in Lebanon and Iraq, and more recently in Bahrain and Syria. With rhetoric emanating from each side about the other's illegitimacy, most often couched in terms of religious orthodoxy or heresy, the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran has ramifications not only in the Gulf or the wider Middle East, but also on the international stage. In order to shed light upon this rivalry, Simon Mabon examines the different identity groups within Saudi Arabia and Iran (made up of various religions, ethnicities and tribal groupings), proposing that internal insecurity has an enormous impact on the wider ideological and geopolitical competition between the two. Focusing on the 'soft power' aspects of foreign policy formation (as opposed to 'hard power'), Mabon draws a nuanced picture of the diplomatic and international relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the ways in which each state has sought to attain a leading position in both the Middle East and Muslim world. Mabon therefore looks at the ways in which each state has a tendency to provide support for identity groups that threaten the security of the other regime, such as Iran's support for the Shi'a of Saudi Arabia, or Saudi Arabia's attempt to strengthen ties with the ethnic Arabs in Iran. With analysis of this heated and often uneasy relationship and its impact on the wider Middle East, this book is vital for those researching international relations and diplomacy in the region.<p><span>Simon Mabon is Lecturer in International Relations in the Department of Politics, Philosophy and Religion at Lancaster University, UK.

Focusing on the latter half of Hosni Mubarak's rule, Dina Jadallah argues that, through its aid policy, the US has attempted to use a reforming and democratising narrative to transform Egypt into a stable 'market-democracy' that would be aligned with US interests in the region. This aim has been pursued in conjunction with one that promoted a comprehensive 'warm peace' with Israel. By highlighting the opposition within Egypt to US aid, Jadallah analyses the key issues that came to the fore during the 2010/11 protests in the country and led to the downfall of Mubarak. Extending her analysis into the post-revolutionary period, the author provides interviews with regime insiders and prominent critics, inside state institutions and outside, who actively challenged the regime. This enables her to assess the different perceptions of US aid both under Mubarak and in the current political situation, contributing to an incisive analysis of modern Egypt and its relations with its superpower ally in the region.Dina Jadallah is a Lecturer of Arabic Language and Society in the Middle East Studies Program at the University of Southern California. She holds a PhD from the School of Near Eastern and North African Studies at the University of Arizona. She is the author of numerous articles dealing with political developments in the Arab world, which have appeared in<i> Arab Studies Quarterly</i>, <i>Jadaliyya</i>, <i>Middle East Journal</i>, <i>Palestine Chronicle</i>, <i>Counterpunch</i>, and <i>Mathal/Mashal </i>among others.The Egyptian SurrealistsRupture, Modernism and the Art and Liberty GroupSam BardaouilThe Art and Liberty Group (Art et Liberté—jama'at al-fann wa al-hurriyyah) was a predominantly Surrealist collective comprising, at its core, a number of artists and writers living and working in Cairo mostly from the late 1930s until the late 1940s. Shedding new light on this fascinating manifestation of Surrealism in Egypt, this book includes a select anthology of literary works by various Art et Liberté members, transcriptions of rare primary documents, and a comprehensive visual inventory of artworks most of which have never been published before. Given its breadth of scope, this monograph will be the first exhaustive academic work of its kind on the art, as well as the literature, of Art et Liberté.Sam Bardaouil is a lecturer, curator and researcher. He was previously Visiting Assistant Professor of Arts at NYU, Assistant Professor of Art History and Theatre at the American University in Dubai, and Lecturer in Art History and Theatre Practice at the American University in Beirut.

Yet much media attention and analysis has been focussed upon the military exploits, brutal tactics and radicalisation methods employed by the group. While ISIS remains a relatively new phenomenon, it is important to consider the historical and local dynamics that have shaped the emergence of the group in the past decade. In this book Simon Mabon and Stephen Royle provide the reader with a comprehensive overview of the roots, tactics and ideology of the group, exploring the interactions of the various participants involved in the formative stages of ISIS.

The artefacts and objects remaining from all corners of this vast empire tell us a great deal about the everyday concerns of the Ottomans. In this book, Faroqhi, a leading historian on the Ottoman Empire, has selected the most revealing, surprising and striking examples of the artefacts which illuminate the lesser-known cultural and artistic world of the Ottomans. Each image—reproduced in full color—is deftly linked to the latest historiography, and the social, political and economic implications of her selections are never forgotten. In Faroqhi's hands, the objects become ways to learn more about trade, gender and socio-political status. They open an enticing window onto the variety and color of everyday life; from the Sultan's court, to the peasantry and slavery.

The capital of this empire was Istanbul, ancient Byzantium, a city that stands astride Europe and Asia on the Bosphorus. And it was in the great palace of Topkapi Sarayi that the sultans of this empire ruled. Inside the Seraglio—a classic of Ottoman history—takes us behind the gilded doors of the Topkapi and into the heart of the palace: the harem, where the sultan would surround himself with his wives, concubines, eunuchs, pages, dwarfs and mutes and where all the tempestuous events of empire were so often played out. This is the history of a remarkable palace in all its colour and opulence and the story of its influence on a great empire.John Freely was born in 1926 in Brooklyn. In 1944, at the age of 17, he enlisted in the US Navy and spent the last two years of World War II serving with a commando unit in Burma and China.

From a quiet acquiescence with EU recommendations to the more recent vocal rhetoric and contrarian positioning, Turkey has managed to negotiate a pivotal position for itself within the wider region. Kubilay Yado Arin looks at this change in foreign policy within the context of Turkey's relationship with the US and the EU. Examining the concepts of hard, soft, and smart power in Turkish foreign policy, he focuses on the US' support of a Turkish bid for EU membership, and what this means for relations between Washington and Ankara. Looking specifically at the ways in which think tanks have an effect on policy-making processes, reshaping the foreign policy agenda at a time of political transformation and regional crises due to the civil conflict in Syria. With conclusions of importance to the world of security studies, its examination of the changes in direction of Turkish foreign policy will also be of interest to researchers of international relations in the wider Middle East.Kubilay Yado Arin is Visiting Scholar at Portland State University's Center for Turkish Studies.  He holds a PhD from the Ludwig-Maximilians University of Munich.

However, many of the contemporary issues affecting Turkish state and society today have their roots not only in the history of the republic, but in the historical and political memory of the state’s imperial history. Here, Fatma Müge Göçek draws on Turkey’s Ottoman heritage and history to explore current issues of ethnicity and religion alongside Turkey’s international position. This new perspective on history’s influence on contemporary tensions in Turkey will contribute to the ongoing debate surrounding Turkey’s accession to the EU, and offers insight into the social transformations in the transition from Ottoman Empire to Turkish Nation-State.

Many seafarers have been terrified by the capricious genies of the ocean, and only by prayer and ritual might crew members hope to ward off any disaster or evil that might befall their ship. </p><p>Central to this archetypal and perilous maritime scene for the Red Sea has been the dhow, the versatile sailing craft that survives to this day and that for many hundreds of years has linked the commercial and pilgrim centers of sea and desert in the region.<span>In his new book, Dionisius A. Agius, one of the foremost scholars of Islamic material culture, offers a lucid and wide-ranging history of the iconic dhow from medieval to modern times. While the history of global and seafaring exploration is more popular than ever, seaborne discovery from Islamic lands remains an understudied subject. </span></p><p><span>Whether discussing trade and salt routes; shoals and wind patterns; spice harvest seasons; litanies and votive offerings to the sea; or the deep and resonant connection between language, memory and oral tradition, this is the first book to place the dhow in its full and remarkable cultural contexts.</span></p><p>Dionisius A. Agius is Al Qasimi Professor of Arabic Studies and Islamic Material 
Culture at the University of Exeter. He is the author of<i> In the Wake of the Dhow</i> 
(1999); and, most recently, <i>Classic Ships of Islam: From Mesopotamia to the 
Indian Ocean</i> (2008).<br></p>The Land of the Thunderbolt MountainsThe Nineteenth-Century Origins of Albanian National IdentityDora d'Istria & Morell Smith, Morelle Smith<p>Dora d'Istria was a distinguished Albanian-Romanian aristocrat whose stimulating ideas offer a fascinating perspective on 19th-century European life. She was born into the ruling family of Romania, married a Russian duke and moved in the uppermost circles of society, counting Longfellow among her many eminent literary correspondents. Her wealth and connections enabled her to pursue her interest in European cultural history and she was passionate about the history of her native-land, Albania. She was fluent in several languages and this book vividly demonstrates her dedication to many causes, including women's rights and Albanian nationalism. </p><p>Published in English for the first time, <i>The Land of the Thunderbolt Mountains</i> showcases D'Istria's writings about Albania. Through the medium of songs and folklore, d'Istria analyses an overlooked aspect of Eastern European history—the theme of nationality and the role of women in its development—and examines in detail the role of Albanian women in different regions of the country. Beautifully written, this book is a treat for everyone interested in the history of the Balkans and Albania.</p><p>Dora d'Istria (the pen name of Elena Ghika) was born in Bucharest in 1828 
into the ruling family of Romania, which originated in Albania. She was the 
author of numerous books, written mainly in French and Italian, including <i>La 
Suisse Allemande</i>, <i>Les Femmes en Orient,</i> <i>Excursions en Roumélie et en Morée</i> and 
<i>La poésie des Ottomans</i>. She travelled widely in both Europe and the United 
States until her death in 1888.</p>The Vision of RumiRevealing the Masnavi, Persia’s Great MasterpieceAlan Williams<p>The Masnavi is the six-volume masterpiece created by one of the world's greatest poetic geniuses, Jalaluddin Rumi (1207-1273). It is perhaps the single most influential piece of mystical writing ever conceived. Though the Persian poet Rumi is now hugely popular in the West, his most famous oeuvre still remains enigmatic. </p><p>Award-winning writer Alan Williams offers a novel approach to reading and understanding this great jewel of world literature in this book. Recognizing that all medieval and modern attempts to 'explain' the Masnavi have been based on an examination of its teachings, Williams shows that those who have tried to find the key to its message in its separate themes have had little success. He argues that the work can only be fully comprehended if the 'meaning' of the text is understood to lie in the poetry itself, in the language. The closely woven tapestry cannot be unwoven into prosaic explanation without losing the whole. The visionary poetic metaphors and devices are not the container for the teachings: they are the teachings. This revelatory unlocking enables Rumi's voice and purpose to become fully transparent.</p><p>Alan Williams is Professor of Iranian Studies and Comparative Religion at the 
University of Manchester. His previous publications include<i> The Zoroastrian Myth 
of Migration from Iran and Settlement in the Indian Diaspora</i> (2009, joint winner 
of the 2010 Ehsan Yarshater Book Award in Ancient Iranian Studies),<i> Parsis in 
India and the Diaspora</i> (co-written with John Hinnells, 2008) and <i>Jalaluddin 
Rumi: Spiritual Verses </i>(2006).<br></p>Badiou ReframedInterpreting Key Thinkers for the ArtsAlex Ling<p>He has been regarded with suspicion by some, as an anti-postmodernist who dared to write about unfashionable concepts such as truth and meaning. But in recent years, the philosopher Alain Badiou has risen in prominence, pioneering new ways to produce, conceptualize and discover art. </p><p><i>Badiou Reframed</i> is an original book about an original thinker which applies—for the first time—Badiou's philosophy to the visual arts. The three central concepts of this philosophy—'being and appearing', 'event and subject' and 'truth and ethics'—are elucidated through detailed analysis of a range of visual artworks, including the films of Jean-Luc Godard, Marcel Duchamp's readymades, the cubist works of Picasso and Braque, the sculpture of Constantin Brancusi and Ossip Zadkine, Kazimir Malevich's suprematist paintings and Steve McQueen's film <i>Hunger</i>. </p><p>In focusing on Badiou's critical relationship with the visual arts, Alex Ling reinterprets and represents not only the man, but art itself.</p><p>Each book in the <i>Contemporary Thinkers Reframed</i> series presents the ideas of famous philosophers using examples in popular art, movies, TV shows, and books. </p>Alex Ling is Lecturer in Culture and Communication at the University of Melbourne (Australia).

world's largest telecommunications equipment manufacturer, firmly establishing 
itself on the world business map. Today, it has over 170,000 employees worldwide 
and in 2014 the company generated a remarkable profit of $5.5 billion. Whilst 
research and development and the technology that results from it are core 
drivers of Huawei's success, the company's amazing growth is also determined by 
its human resource strategy. This is based on a \"customer-first\" attitude, the 
belief that obtaining opportunities is through hard work and, above all, \"a 
dedication to do the best in anything we do.\" How Huawei promotes this 
dedication amongst its workforce is the subject of this important book. Through 
original incentive systems, employee ownership and the mentality to act like a 
boss, Huawei has managed to create a culture of dedication that has become the 
bedrock of its growth today.<br></p><p>Weiwei Huang is a professor of business at Renmin University of China. He has

These writers pursued both men and women, and expressed romantic attachments to the bucolic countryside as well as to the city of Rome. At the same time, they initiated a vibrant exchange with other genres and authors, and explored the art of writing as much as the experience of love itself. </div><div><br></div><div>This new and attractive survey of a genre that is often called elegy - because of its meter - discusses the poets and their writings against the turbulent backdrop of the Augustan age (31 BCE-14 CE). It examines the literary origins of Latin elegy, highlights the poets' key themes and traces their reception by later writers and readers. Introducing the chief Latin elegists, as well as these poets' main sources of inspiration (Catullus, Cornelius Gallus and earlier Greek elegists like Euphorion of Chalcis), the book shows that love elegy is the defining genre of Roman poetry.<br><p></p></div><div>Denise Eileen McCoskey is Associate Professor of Classics and Black World Studies at Miami University of Ohio, USA and is the author of <i>Race: Antiquity and its Legacy</i> (I.B.Tauris, 2011).<br><br>Zara Martirosova Torlone is Associate Professor of Classics at Miami University of Ohio, USA and is the author of <i>Russia and the Classics: Poetry's Foreign Muse</i> (2009).<br><p></p></div>African Americans and the ClassicsAntiquity, Abolition and ActivismMargaret Malamud<p>A new wave of research in black classicism has emerged in the 21st century that explores the role played by the classics in the larger cultural traditions of black America, Africa and the Caribbean.

Black Power movement has left a more complex legacy. Its original leaders, 
Stokely Carmichael and Willie Ricks, were Black Nationalists, advocating a 
militant and extremist approach to tackle racism, while other leaders, such as 
Bobby Seale of the Black Panthers, believed that the struggle for Black Power 
was essentially a class struggle. Beginning with the folk-narratives told 
through song by slaves in the plantations, through the Harlem renaissance of the 
1920s and 30s, the era of Malcolm X, the African-American art and fashion of the

Truman immediately after World War II to provide covert political and military support to further US foreign policy. Strengthened by President Eisenhower, by the early 1950s, under the command of Allen Dulles, the CIA was actively overthrowing governments - Prime Minister Mossadegh in Iran in 1953, and President Árbenz Guzmán in Guatemala in 1954. The Agency was less involved in Eastern Europe, however, where the Soviet Union had established control – despite opportunities for US interference such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Czechoslovak revolt in 1968. Here, Stephen Long challenges the accepted view that the US accepted a post-World War II ordering of Europe which placed the East outside an American 'sphere of influence'. He argues instead that 'disorder prevailed over design' in the planning and organization of espionage during the early stages of the Cold War. Featuring new archival material, and unpicking the relationship between the CIA, the US government and the Soviet Union, The CIA and the Soviet Bloc sheds new light on espionage, the Cold War, US diplomatic history and the history of 20th century Europe.</p></div><DIV>Stephen Long is Lecturer in American History and Foreign Relations at the University of Nottingham.</p></div>Eisenhower and the Cold War Arms Race‘Open Skies' and the Military-Industrial ComplexHelen Bury<DIV>Under the growing shadow of the Cold War, President Eisenhower announced his 'Open Skies' initiative to Soviet, British and French delegations at the Geneva Summit in 1955. In a climate of intense fear and suspicion, this proposed system of mutual aerial inspection was dismissed by Khrushchev and the Soviet Union as nothing more than an 'espionage plot'. Nevertheless, Eisenhower campaigned for its implementation until the end of his presidency. Here, Helen Bury provides a new interpretation of Eisenhower's 'Open Skies' program, arguing that it functioned as a corrective to John Foster Dulles' 'New Look' defense strategy - which relied on the threat of massive nuclear retaliation. A critic of the 'military-industrial' complex which was gaining power in American statecraft and which sought to expand military spending, Eisenhower aimed instead to safeguard the economic strength of America. Eisenhower and the Military-Industrial Complex is the first in-depth study of the Open Skies policy and essential reading for historians of the Cold War and the International Relations of the United States.</p></div><DIV>Helen Bury has just completed her PhD in Modern History under Gerard De Groot at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

The policy of containment was formed, China was established as an important military power, and the US increased its military expenditure fourfold as a result of a conflict which killed over 33,000 Americans. What has been less appreciated is the role played by the United Nations and the British Commonwealth in influencing US strategy at this time of crisis: the Truman administration invested time and effort into gaining UN approval for the conflict in Korea, and the course of the war was adapted to keep UN allies, often holding crucial strategic positions in other Cold War theatres, in tow. This groundbreaking study explores these fluctuating relationships, the tensions between Washington and its British Commonwealth allies and their impact on the development of the conflict, from its outbreak in 1950 to its end at the Geneva Conference of 1954. Robert Barnes reframes the Korean War for the first time in the context of a United States less dominant than is usually imagined.

Heidegger Reframed grounds Heidegger's writings in the critical questions confronting contemporary visual artists and students of art. Barbara Bolt takes the most relevant of his texts, including his most famous work, Being and Time, and sets out ways of thinking about art in a post-medium, digital, technocratic and post-human age. She does so through the frame of works by international artists, including Sophie Calle, Anish Kapoor and Anselm Kiefer. A glossary of terms completes this full and clear companion to Heidegger.Barbara Bolt lectures at the Victorian College of the Arts at the University of Melbourne, Australia. She is a practising artist and her publications include Art Beyond Representation: The Performative Power of the Image (2004) and Practice as Research: Approaches to Creative Arts Enquiry (edited with Estelle Barrett, I.B.Tauris, 2007, paperback 2010).Kristeva ReframedA Guide for the Arts StudentsEstelle BarrettFor Kristeva, in a world immersed in readymade images, art or aesthetic experience is a practice that constitutes both a subject (a sense of self) and an object that is able to transform meaning and consciousness. Kristeva Reframed examines key ideas in Kristeva's work to show how they are most relevant to artists, and how they can be applied in interpreting artworks. With examples from the paintings of van Gogh and Picasso, the work of contemporary eminist painters, the photography of Bill Henson and the film and animation work of Van Sowerine, Estelle Barrett demonstrates how Kristeva can lluminate the relationships between artist and art object, between artists, artworks and audiences, and between art and knowledge. Through these relationships she explores what Kristeva's work reveals about the role and function of art in society and offers a smooth passage through Kristeva's ideas and her relevance to visual culture.Estelle Barrett is Associate Professor and Deputy Head of the School of Communication and Creative Arts at Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia.

Taking issue with the understanding both of philosophy and of Christianity by certain secular humanists, Brown shows that in antiquity, philosophy was never an abstracted activity but was actually about determining the good and valuable in life, and was therefore at the end of the day, a pragmatic approach to life, and not an abstract one. </p><p>Christianity (which is also, and above all, concerned with value and the good life) did not graft its philosophy onto its religious beliefs as some sort of adjunct, from elsewhere, but is intrinsically philosophical in a unique sense. For contra-secular philosophers like A C Grayling and Simon Blackburn, who view Christianity as philosophically impoverished, there is no meaningful distinction, then, between 'religious belief' and 'philosophical reason', since, like its classical counterparts, early Christianity was a distinct philosophy in its own right. And since Christian philosophy was apocalyptic in character, and looked to the future, it resisted the notion of absolute certainty in the present. </p><p>For Brown, therefore, a true understanding of the nature of Christian philosophy has much to tell us about the fundamentally liberal and anti-authoritarian character of Christianity - an insight that has considerable present-day resonance in the light of recent fundamentalist attempts to re-position the churches according to a more conservative agenda.</p><p><br></p><p>Alan Brown is at the University of Durham<br></p>The I.B.Tauris History of MonasticismThe Western TraditionAndrea Janelle Dickens<p>From the earliest centuries of the church, asceticism and the contemplative life have been profoundly important aspects of western Christianity. And in assessing the glories of western civilization, perhaps the best place to start is within medieval monastic institutions, not outside of them. For while monasteries withdrew from the main currents of their societies, until the rise of universities in the 12th century they provided fertile soil and sanctuary to the liberal arts and sciences as well as those who wanted to spend their lives focused upon God. They became the driving cultural forces of Europe, nurturing education, music, manuscript illumination, art and history, agriculture, animal husbandry—all in addition to spiritual guidance. </p><p>In this first general history of monasticism since 1900, Andrea Dickens explores the cloistered communities and individuals who have aspired to the ascetic ideal in their religious life, assessing the impact they have made on the wider church and its practices. She discusses some of the best known names in Christian history—including Cuthbert, Columba, Hilda of Whitby, Peter Abelard and Thomas Merton—and traces the monastic impulse from its beginnings in the Egyptian desert through the Rule of St Benedict, Cluny's foundation in 910, the austerity of the Cistercians, the legacy of women's houses, the critique of Luther and Calvin, Trappists and Catholic reform, up to the present-day ecumencial Taizé community. </p><p>Offering a lively and informed overview of western monasticism, the book will be essential reading for students of history and religion as well as the lay reader.</p>GR Evans is Emeritus Professor of Medieval Theology and Intellectual History in the University of Cambridge.SenecaUnderstanding ClassicsChristopher  Star<p>After centuries of neglect, there is renewed interest in the life and works of Lucius Annaeus Seneca (or Seneca the Younger, c 4 BCE-65 CE). At one time an advisor at court to Nero, Seneca and his political career came to ruin when he was implicated in a later plot to kill the capricious and matricidal emperor, and compelled to commit suicide. Discredited through collusion, or at least association, with a notorious and tyrannical regime, Seneca's ideas were for a time also considered derivative of Greek stoicism and thus inferior to the real thing. </p><p>In this first in-depth introduction to be published for many years, Christopher Star shows what a remarkable statesman, dramatist and philosopher his subject actually was. Seneca's original contributions to political philosophy and the philosophy of the emotions were considerable. He was a favorite authority of Tertullian, who saw Seneca as proto-believer and early humanist. And he is a key figure in the history of ideas and the Renaissance, as well as in literature and drama. This new survey does full justice to his significance.</p>Christopher Star is Associate Professor of Classics at Middlebury College, Vermont.

StephensAlexandria was the greatest of the new cities founded by Alexander the Great as his armies swept eastward. It was ruled by his successors, the Ptolemies, who presided over one of the richest and most productive periods in the whole of Greek literature. Susan A Stephens here reveals a cultural world in transition: reverential of the compositions of the past (especially after construction of the great library, repository for all previous Greek oeuvres), but at the same time forward-looking and experimental, willing to make use of previous forms of writing in exciting new ways. The author examines Alexandria's poets in turn. She discusses the strikingly avant-garde Aetia of Callimachus; the idealized pastoral forms of Theocritus (which anticipated the invention of fiction); and the neo-Homerian epic of Apollonius, the Argonautica, with its impressive combination of narrative grandeur and psychological acuity. She shows that all three poets were innovators, even while they looked to the past for inspiration: drawing upon Homer, Hesiod, Pindar and the lyric poets, they emphasized stories and material that were entirely relevant to their own progressive cosmopolitan environment.Susan A Stephens is Sara Hart Kimball Professor in the Humanities and Professor of Classics at Stanford University. Her books include <i>Seeing Double: Intercultural Poetics in Ptolemaic Alexandria</i> (2003), <i>Callimachus in Context: From Plato to the Augustan Poets</i> (with Benjamin Acosta-Hughes, 2012) and <i>Callimachus: The Hymns </i>(2015).PlutarchUnderstanding ClassicsMark A.  Beck<p>"To be ignorant of the lives of the most celebrated men of antiquity is to continue in a state of childhood all our days." </p><p>When Plutarch, a Greek historian and biographer writing under the auspices of the Roman empire, wrote these words, he left an enduring legacy that is still felt today. His masterwork, the <i>Lives</i>, is arguably one of the most important bodies of historical writing to survive from antiquity. Unique in its parallel format and frequent focus on the charmingly anecdotal as opposed to the great events in the lives of the men it described, it was in many ways a precursor to the modern biography. The <i>Moralia</i>—Plutarch's collection of essays, dialogues and speeches—may be lesser-known, but has been no less influential, inspiring Montaigne's famous <i>Essais </i>and the development of the essay as a popular form of writing throughout the Western world. </p><p>In his new introduction to an ancient writer who is still a literary giant, Mark Beck explores the cultural and philosophical influences on Plutarch's writing; the evidence for his life; the essential unity behind his work; his reception; and his great versatility as philosopher, moralist, historian and biographer.</p>Mark A Beck is Associate Professor of Classics at the University of South Carolina. He is the editor of <i>A Companion to Plutarch</i> (forthcoming).TacitusUnderstanding ClassicsVictoria Emma  Pagán<p>The greatest of Roman historians, Publius Cornelius Tacitus (56-117 CE) studied rhetoric in Rome. His rhetorical and oratorical gifts are evident throughout his most substantial works, the incomplete but still remarkable Annals and Histories. In concise and concentrated prose, marked by sometimes bitter and ironic reflections on the human capacity to misuse power, Tacitus charts the violent trajectory of the Roman Empire from Augustus' death in 14 CE to the end of Domitian's rule in 96. Victoria Emma Pagán looks at Tacitus from a range of perspectives: as a literary stylist, perhaps influenced by Sallust; his notion of time; his modes of discourse; his place in the historiography of the era; and the later reception of Tacitus in the Renaissance and early modern periods. </p><p>Tacitus remains of major interest to students of the Bible, as well as classicists, by virtue of his reference to 'Christus' and Nero's persecution of the Christians after the great fire of Rome in 64 CE. This lively survey enables its readers fully to appreciate why, in holding a mirror up to venality and greed, the work of Tacitus remains eternal.</p>Victoria Emma Pagán is Professor of Classics at the University of Florida.

Watson & Patricia Watson, Patricia Watson<p>Lindsay C. and Patricia Watson provide an attractive overview—for students of classics and ancient history, as well as comparative literature—of the chief themes of Marcus Valerius Martialias' (or Martial's) sardonic writings.</p><p>Martial was a great Roman poet from Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) best known for his twelve books of Epigrams, published in Rome between AD 86 and 103, during the reigns of the emperors Domitian, Nerva and Trajan. In these short, witty poems he cheerfully satirizes city life and the scandalous activities of his acquaintances, and romanticizes his provincial upbringing. He wrote a total of 1,561, of which 1,235 are in elegiac couplets, and is considered to be the creator of the modern epigram. </p>Lindsay C Watson is Associate Professor of Classics and Ancient History at the University of Sydney.<p>Patricia Watson is Honorary Associate in Classics and Ancient History at the same institution.</p>OvidUnderstanding ClassicsCarole E. Newlands<p>Publius Ovidius Naso ( 43 BC – AD 17/18), or Ovid, was a Roman poet who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was a contemporary of the older Virgil and Horace, with whom he is often ranked as one of the three canonical poets of Latin literature. The Imperial scholar Quintilian considered him the last of the Latin love elegists, and during his life, he enjoyed enormous popularity, but, in one of the mysteries of literary history, he was sent by Augustus into exile in a remote province on the Black Sea, where he remained until his death. Ovid himself attributes his exile to carmen et error, "a poem and a mistake", but his discretion in discussing the causes has resulted in much speculation among scholars.</p><p>All of the poet's major works are covered and analyzed here, and author Newlands details how the great writer has had a lasting impact on Western literature, not only through his extensive works that have been enjoyed through the centuries, but including being a major influence on Shakespeare and one of the major sources for our knowledge of classical mythology. </p><p><br></p>Carole E.

But for all the sophistication of his thinking, it is perhaps for his political and oratorical career that Cicero is best remembered. He was the nemesis of Catiline, whose plot to overthrow the Republic he famously denounced to the Senate. He was the selfless Consul who turned down the opportunity to join Julius Caesar and Pompey in their ruling triumvirate with Crassus. He was briefly Rome's leading man after Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE. And he was the indecisive schemer whose personal ambitions and bitter rivalry with Mark Antony led to his own violent death in 43 BCE as an enemy of the state. In her authoritative survey, Gesine Manuwald evokes the many faces of Cicero, as well as his complexities and seeming contradictions. She focuses on his major writings, allowing the great rhetorician to speak for himself. Cicero's rich legacy is seen to endure in the works of Plutarch and Quintilian as well as in the speeches of Winston Churchill and Barack Obama.</p></div><DIV>Gesine Manuwald is Professor of Latin at University College, London, UK.

Burgess<div>What reader could fail to be enthralled by the <i>Iliad </i>and the <i>Odyssey</i>, those greatest heroic epics of antiquity? Yet the author of these immortal texts remains, in the end, an enigma. The central paradox of Homer is that – while recognized as producing poetry of incomparable genius – even in the ancient world nobody knew who he was. As a result, the mythmaker became the subject of myth. For the satirist Lucian (c 125 – c 180 CE) he was a captive Babylonian. Other traditions have Homer born on Smyrna or the island of Chios, or portray him as a blind and wandering minstrel. </div><div><br></div><div>In his new and authoritative introduction, Jonathan Burgess addresses fundamental questions of provenance and authorship. Besides conveying why these epics have been cherished down the ages, he discusses their historical sources and the possible impact on the Iliad and Odyssey of Indo-European, Near Eastern and folktale influences. Tracing their transmission through the ancient, medieval and modern periods, the author further examines questions of later reception and the use made of Homer in colonialism and imperialism.<p></p></div><div>Jonathan S Burgess is Professor of Classics at the University of Toronto, Canada.

Johnson<div>Eusebius of Caesarea (263-339 CE) is one of the most important intellectuals whose writings survive from late antiquity. His texts made lasting and wide-ranging contributions, from history-writing and apologetics to Biblical commentary and Christian oratory. He was a master of many of the literary and scholarly traditions of the Greek heritage. Yet he left none of these traditions unaltered as he made brilliant and original experiments in the many genres he explored. </div><div><br></div><div>Aaron P Johnson offers a lively introduction to Eusebius' chief oeuvre while also discussing recent scholarship on this foundational early Christian writer. Placing Eusebius in the context of his age the author provides a full account his life, including the period when Eusebius controversially sought to assist the heretic Arius.

These writers pursued both men and women, and expressed romantic attachments to the bucolic countryside as well as to the city of Rome. At the same time, they initiated a vibrant exchange with other genres and authors, and explored the art of writing as much as the experience of love itself. </div><div><br></div><div>This new and attractive survey of a genre that is often called elegy - because of its meter - discusses the poets and their writings against the turbulent backdrop of the Augustan age (31 BCE-14 CE). It examines the literary origins of Latin elegy, highlights the poets' key themes and traces their reception by later writers and readers. Introducing the chief Latin elegists, as well as these poets' main sources of inspiration (Catullus, Cornelius Gallus and earlier Greek elegists like Euphorion of Chalcis), the book shows that love elegy is the defining genre of Roman poetry.<br><p></p></div><div>Denise Eileen McCoskey is Associate Professor of Classics and Black World Studies at Miami University of Ohio, USA and is the author of <i>Race: Antiquity and its Legacy</i> (I.B.Tauris, 2011).<br><br>Zara Martirosova Torlone is Associate Professor of Classics at Miami University of Ohio, USA and is the author of <i>Russia and the Classics: Poetry's Foreign Muse</i> (2009).<br><p></p></div>PindarUnderstanding ClassicsRichard Stoneman<div>The 6th/5th century BCE Greek melic (or songwriting) poet Pindar was one of the most celebrated lyricists of antiquity. His famous victory odes offer a paean to the heroic athlete, and collectively are an attempt to encapsulate, through choral songs of exaltation, the glory of the sportsman's moment of victory - whether in athletics or horse-racing - at a variety of Panhellenic festivals and Olympian games. Yet Pindar, though still respected, is now considered a difficult poet, and is sometimes dismissed as a reactionary, celebrating an aristocratic world that was passing and that deserved to pass. </div><div><br></div><div>In this first work on the subject for many years, Richard Stoneman shows that Pindar's works, while at first seeming obscure and fragmentary, reward further study. An unmatched craftsman with words, and witness to a profoundly religious sensibility, he is a poet who takes modern readers to the heart of Greek ideas about the gods, fleeting human achievement and fallibility. The author examines questions of performance and genre; patronage; imagery; and reception, beginning with Horace.<br><p></p></div><div>Richard Stoneman is Honorary Fellow in Classics at the University of Exeter, UK and editor of the Understanding Classics series.

From her poverty-stricken upbringing as an illegitimate child in rural Argentina, Perón made her way to the highest echelons of Argentinean society, via a brief acting career and her relationship with Juan. After their political breakthrough, her charitable work and magnetic personality earned her wide public acclaim, and there was national mourning following her death from cancer at the age of just 33. </p><p>Based on new sources and first-hand interviews, the book will seek to explore the personality and experiences of 'Evita' and the contemporary events that influenced her and were in turn influenced by her.

He is known as the savior of the Union, victor in the American Civil War, and the Great Emancipator of slaves. But is this glowing reputation deserved? In this engaging and sometimes provocative new book, Alan Sked overturns the consensus on an American hero, and provides an original angle on the political career of an otherwise impenetrable figure. </p><p>The cult of Abraham Lincoln is based on two propositions: first, that he was forced into Civil War in 1861 by Southern determination to secede, but managed to save the Union; and second, that he used the war to implement his long-held desire to free America's slaves. Sked contests these assumptions with fresh new research, shedding light on the truth behind the causes of the Civil War and Lincoln's problematic relationship with African-Americans. </p><p>Was the Civil War inevitable? Did Lincoln's dogged insistence on the illegality of secession needlessly cost 650,000 lives that could have been spared? Did Lincoln receive a democratic mandate in 1860 with only 39% of the overall vote? What was his attitude toward Native Americans? What really were his views on the liberation of African-American slaves?

He shows how Britain was persuaded to join a war it could ill afford, and was forced to rearm at great cost to the economy. The decision to participate in the war caused great strain to the Labour party—provoking the Bevan-Gaitskell split which was to keep the party out of office for the next decade. </p><p>McLaine's revisionist study shows how disastrous the war was for the British—and for the Labour party in particular.

An attempt to stem the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence, the conflict in practice created a chaotic state torn apart by espionage, terrorism and guerilla warfare. American troops quickly became embroiled in jungle warfare and knowledge of the other side's troop movements, communication lines, fighting techniques and strategy became crucial. </p><p>Panagiotis Dimitrakis uncovers this battle for intelligence and tells the story of the Vietnam War through the newly available British, American and French sources—including declassified material. In doing so he dissects the limitations of the CIA, the NSA, the MI6 and the French intelligence agency, the SDECE, in gathering actionable intelligence. Dimitrakis also shows how the Vietminh under Ho Chi Minh established their own secret services; how their high-grade moles infiltrated the US and French military echelons and the government of South Vietnam, and how Hanoi's intelligence apparatus eventually suffered seriously from 'spies amongst us' paranoia.

Through a detailed reading of primary literature, Sebastian Herbstreuth also shows how the dangers of foreign oil are linked to American descriptions of foreign oil producers as culturally different und thus 'undependable'. Herbstreuth shows how even reliable imports from the Middle East are portrayed as dangerous and undesirable because this region is particularly 'foreign' from an American point of view, while oil from friendly countries like Canada is cast as a benign form of energy trade. Oil and American Identity rewrites the history of U.S. foreign oil dependence as a cultural history of the United States in the 20th century.Sebastian Herbstreuth completed his PhD in American History, Politics and International Relations at Cambridge University.

was essentially a class struggle. Beginning with the folk-narratives told 
through song by slaves in the plantations, through the Harlem renaissance of the

Under President Eisenhower the US pursued a policy of support for dictators, the economic shoring up of regimes that impoverished their own people and sanctioned direct interventions such as the overthrow of the Guatemalan government in 1954. When John F. Kennedy came to power, he promised a reset of relations and set about pouring aid into Latin America. Yet in 1961 Kennedy also attempted to intervene in Central American domestic politics with the Bay of Pigs operation. How far was each of the approaches pursued by the two administrations responsible for increasing tensions and encouraging radicalism on the continent? In answering this question Bevan Sewell shows how Eisenhower's strategic stance on the Cold War became increasingly detrimental to Latin America over time, and shows how similar policies were continued by the Kennedy administration. The US and Latin America provides a new lens through which to assess US policy towards Latin America at an important time in inter-American relations.Bevan Sewell is Lecturer in American History at the University of Nottingham.The Cultural Left and the Reagan EraU.S. Protest and the Central American RevolutionDr. Nick Witham<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="color:#1F497D;mso-ansi-language:

Truman immediately after World War II to provide covert political and military support to further US foreign policy. Strengthened by President Eisenhower, by the early 1950s, under the command of Allen Dulles, the CIA was actively overthrowing governments - Prime Minister Mossadegh in Iran in 1953, and President Árbenz Guzmán in Guatemala in 1954. The Agency was less involved in Eastern Europe, however, where the Soviet Union had established control – despite opportunities for US interference such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Czechoslovak revolt in 1968. Here, Stephen Long challenges the accepted view that the US accepted a post-World War II ordering of Europe which placed the East outside an American 'sphere of influence'. He argues instead that 'disorder prevailed over design' in the planning and organization of espionage during the early stages of the Cold War. Featuring new archival material, and unpicking the relationship between the CIA, the US government and the Soviet Union, The CIA and the Soviet Bloc sheds new light on espionage, the Cold War, US diplomatic history and the history of 20th century Europe.</p></div><DIV>Stephen Long is Lecturer in American History and Foreign Relations at the University of Nottingham.</p></div>Eisenhower and the Cold War Arms Race‘Open Skies' and the Military-Industrial ComplexHelen Bury<DIV>Under the growing shadow of the Cold War, President Eisenhower announced his 'Open Skies' initiative to Soviet, British and French delegations at the Geneva Summit in 1955. In a climate of intense fear and suspicion, this proposed system of mutual aerial inspection was dismissed by Khrushchev and the Soviet Union as nothing more than an 'espionage plot'. Nevertheless, Eisenhower campaigned for its implementation until the end of his presidency. Here, Helen Bury provides a new interpretation of Eisenhower's 'Open Skies' program, arguing that it functioned as a corrective to John Foster Dulles' 'New Look' defense strategy - which relied on the threat of massive nuclear retaliation. A critic of the 'military-industrial' complex which was gaining power in American statecraft and which sought to expand military spending, Eisenhower aimed instead to safeguard the economic strength of America. Eisenhower and the Military-Industrial Complex is the first in-depth study of the Open Skies policy and essential reading for historians of the Cold War and the International Relations of the United States.</p></div><DIV>Helen Bury has just completed her PhD in Modern History under Gerard De Groot at the University of St. Andrews, UK.

The policy of containment was formed, China was established as an important military power, and the US increased its military expenditure fourfold as a result of a conflict which killed over 33,000 Americans. What has been less appreciated is the role played by the United Nations and the British Commonwealth in influencing US strategy at this time of crisis: the Truman administration invested time and effort into gaining UN approval for the conflict in Korea, and the course of the war was adapted to keep UN allies, often holding crucial strategic positions in other Cold War theatres, in tow. This groundbreaking study explores these fluctuating relationships, the tensions between Washington and its British Commonwealth allies and their impact on the development of the conflict, from its outbreak in 1950 to its end at the Geneva Conference of 1954. Robert Barnes reframes the Korean War for the first time in the context of a United States less dominant than is usually imagined. This will be essential reading for students of International Relations, Cold War Studies and modern History.</p></div><DIV>Robert Barnes is teaching fellow in the Department of International History at the LSE, where he recently completed his PhD in International History.</p></div>UnmaskedCorruption in the WestLaurence Cockcroft & Anne Wegener, Anne Christine Wegener<p>How corrupt is the West? Europe and North America's formal self-perception is one of high standards in public life. And yet, corruption is receiving ever greater attention in the European, American and Canadian press, with high-profile cases affecting both the corporate and political worlds. </p><p>This hard-hitting and thoroughly-researched book identifies the driving forces behind such cases, particularly the role of political finance, lobbying, the banking system, and organized crime. It analyses the sectors which are particularly prone to corruption, including sport, defense and pharmaceuticals. In the course of their investigation, the authors consider why anti-corruption legislation has not been more effective and why there is an increasing discrepancy between regulation and commercial and cultural practice. Are Europe and the US genuinely serious about fighting corruption, and if so, what measures will be taken to roll it back?</p><p>A multi-national look at the causes and the curses of corruption in political and business life, <i>Unmasked </i>is one of the first books to examine corruption as a major problem that must be addressed up front, and not as something that doesn't happen in this part of the world. </p>Laurence Cockcroft is a Development Economist.

Yet much of the iconic architecture and culture which so defines the city as we know it today—from the Empire State Building to the Pastrami sandwich—only came into being in the 1930s, in what was perhaps the most significant decade in the city's 400-year history. After the roaring twenties, the catastrophic Wall Street Crash and ensuing Depression seemed to spell disaster for the vibrant city. Yet, in this era, New York underwent an architectural, economic, social and creative renaissance under the leadership of the charismatic mayor Fiorello La Guardia. After seizing power, he declared war on the mafia mobs running vast swathes of the city, attacked political corruption and kick-started the economy through a variety of construction and infrastructure projects. In culture, this was the age of the Harlem Renaissance championed by writers like Langston Hughes, the jazz age with the advent of Tin-Pan Alley, the Cotton Club and immortals such as Duke Ellington making his name in the Big Apple. Weaving these stories together, Jules Stewart tells the story of an iconic city in a time of change.<p>Jules Stewart is a journalist, historian and author. He was born in New York and

This book explores the relationship between fashion and criminality. It sets out to develop from interdisciplinary perspectives, new ways of seeing everyday dress and the individual body in the public space. It focuses on specific garments and their individual or group wearers—the Hoodie and the trench-coat, knitted Norwegian Lustkoffe sweaters and low-slung trousers, branded sportswear and Hip Hop styling, the fashion model—innocuous in themselves, but which have been coded as deviant socially and in the media. It questions the point at which morality as a form of social control meets criminality and demonstrates how such established dress codes and terms as 'suitability' or 'glamour' can be renegotiated through the exploration of what people wear every day in response to notions of criminality.<p>Joanne Turney is Senior Lecturer in History of Design, Bath School of Art &

Stookey, Robert W StookeyThe termination of the British Mandate in Palestine was a momentous turning point in Middle Eastern history, marked by the failure of the British to bring about a workable political composition between the Arab and Jewish communities, the subsequent referral of the problem to the United Nations and the emergence of the state of Israel, in part through effective diplomacy, but more particularly by force of arms. The underlying problems caused by the Mandate persist to this day, as intractable as ever, with serious consequences both for local security and international relations. This book provides a detailed overview of the dispute's historical origins, setting forth, one by one, the perspectives, motivations and objectives of the principal actors in the termination of the Mandate: Great Britain, as the mandatory power; the United States, as the pivot of the Zionist movement; the Soviet Union, preoccupied with the liquidation of the Western empires; the Zionists and the Arabs, both the Palestinians and the sovereign Arab states.

Bearing this in mind, Yasmeen Abu-Laban and Abigail Bakan discuss the historic and contemporary developments in Israel/Palestine, and their international reverberations, from the unique vantage point of 'race', racialization, racism and anti-racism. They therefore offer close analysis of the 'idea' of Israel and the 'absence' of Palestine by examining the concepts of race and identity in the region. With fresh coverage of themes relating to gender, indigeneity, the environment, surveillance and the war on terror, Israel, Palestine and the Politics of Race will appeal to scholars in political science, sociology and Middle East studies.Yasmeen Abu-Laban is a Proessor in the Department of Political Science, The University of Alberta.Islam in AmericaJonathan CurielIslam is the hidden ingredient in the melting pot of America. Though there are between 2 and 8 million Muslims in the U.S., Islam has traditionally had little political clout compared to other minority faiths. However, it has been a part of the fabric of the United States from its conception. African people, brought over in the slave trade, formed the roots of American Islam, their faith challenged and suppressed by slaveowners. Nonetheless, great American thinkers were proponents of the faith, including Thomas Jefferson, who studied Islam, and Ralph Waldo Emerson who spoke of its importance and influence.Since then, Islam has taken on many guises-from slavery, as a part of the Civil Rights movement, as a metonym for extremism, to Middle America; there is now at least one Mosque in all fifty States.Islam is believed to be the country's fastest-growing religion with a vibrant culture of theological debate, particularly regarding the role of women preachers. In Islam in America, Curiel traces the history of America's Muslims. Drawing on interviews in communities from industrial Michigan to rural California, Curiel portrays the diversity of practices, cultures and observances that make up Muslim America.Jonathan Curiel is a former staff writer for the San Francisco Chronicle. His work has also appeared in the Columbia Journalism Review, Salon.com and the Los Angeles Times.Islamic Movements of EuropeFrank Peter & Rafael Ortega, Rafael Ortega<p><span>'Islam in Europe' and 'Islamophobia' are subjects of vital global importance which currently preoccupy policy-makers and academics alike. Through the examination of various European Muslim groups and institutions that have branched off from Islamic movements - including the Muslim Brotherhood, Hizb ut-Tahrir and Jama'at-i Islami - this book outlines the configuration of social, political and religious processes that have given rise to new kinds of European Muslim organisations. The authors offer a new perspective on these Muslim groups and seek to reclaim them from the often highly-charged public debates by placing them within the context of their origins as politicised religious movements on the one hand and their ongoing incorporation into European societal structures on the other. They also consider the relationship of these organisations to their 'parent' movements and examine the presence of Islam in European education and higher education institutions. Taking into account the connection between Islamic movements and the perceived surge of 'Islamophobia' in Europe, this book does not debate the question of whether these groups fit into normative or cultural structures of European nation-states, but rather examines how these structures have changed through their interaction with these groups and the growing Muslim population within Europe. It does not consider political Islam as the antithesis to a refined notion of secularism, but as a form of public religion which contributes to the ever-changing structure of Europe's secular regimes. Featuring the work of more than 40 scholars from around the world, this is the comprehensive guide to Islamic movements in Europe, offering original, definitive perspectives on Muslims and Islam in Europe today. It will be essential reading for policy-makers, political commentators and scholars alike.</span><br></p><p><span>Frank Peter is Assistant Professor of Islamic Studies at the University of Berne.

Yet they remain a mysterious—almost unknowable—organisation. Through exhaustive on-the-ground reporting, M.J. Smith takes readers inside the violence and provides the first in-depth account of the conflict. He traces Boko Haram from its beginnings as a small Islamist sect in Nigeria's remote northeast, led by a baby-faced but charismatic preacher, to its transformation into a hydra-headed monster, deploying suicide bombers and abducting innocent schoolgirls. Much of the book is told through the eyes of Nigerians who have found themselves caught between the violence of a shadowy group of insurgents, brutal security forces accused of horrifying abuses and an inept government led by an accidental president. It includes the voices of a forgotten police officer left paralysed by an attack, women whose husbands have been murdered and a sword-wielding vigilante using charms to fend off insurgent bullets. It journeys through the sleaze and corruption that has robbed Africa's biggest oil producer of its potential, making it such fertile ground for extremism. Along the way it questions whether there can be any end to the violence and the ways in which this might be achieved. Interspersed with history, this book delves into the roots of this unholy war being waged against the backdrop of an evolving extremist threat worldwide.Mike Smith is a foreign correspondent for AFP news agency and was bureau chief in Western Africa from 2010 to 2013, based in Nigeria. He has extensively covered the Boko Haram insurgency.Voices of JihadNew Writings on Radical IslamKamran Bokhari<DIV>The 21st century has seen an unprecedented radicalization of Muslims across the world. In some cases, this has led to terror and violence. Yet as the West pours huge military resources into the ""war on terror,"" we still know very little about the ideology which drives the terrorists. Now, for the first time, Kamran Bokhari has made it possible to hear and to digest today's militant Islam in its own words. He presents a range of ideologues from across the globe, including Bin Laden's own deputy, Ayman Zawahari. Bokhari's carefully contextualized selection introduces us to radical Islamist thinking on a range of issues such as their perception of Western concepts of democracy, their skepticism towards the Middle East peace process and how to deal with the West. For anyone who wants to understand the phenomenon of contemporary militant Islam, or who wants to know what motivates terrorist thinking, this book is essential reading.</p></div><DIV><b>Kamran Bokhari </b>is the senior Middle East analyst for Stratfor Geopolitical Analysts.<BR></div>The Tribes of ISISInfiltrating Terror Networks in the Middle EastHassan HassanHow has one of the most extreme jihadist groups ever known gained a foothold across swaths of Iraq and Syria? How has ISIS exploited fault lines and built influence within key tribal areas? Syrian journalist Hassan Hassan delves deep into the tribal dynamics of the region, seeking to understand how ISIS has been operating, often with great success, alongside these groups for over a decade. Through first-hand experience, interviews with key tribal figures and ISIS members, Hassan demonstrates the central part tribes play within Iraq and Syria, and that the efforts to overcome ISIS must find a way to separate the jihadist movement from these groups on the ground.Hassan Hassan is a journalist and analyst who has written extensively on ISIS.

These dreadful reprisals are little talked of in Angola today—and virtually unknown outside the country. In this book, journalist Lara Pawson tracks down the story of what really happened in the aftermath of that fateful day. In a series of vivid encounters, she talks to eyewitnesses, victims and even perpetrators of the violent and confusing events of the 27th May and the following weeks and months. From London to Lisbon to Luanda, she meets those who continue to live in the shadow of the appalling events of 40 years ago and who—in most cases—have been too afraid to speak about them before. As well as shedding light on the events of 1977, this book contributes to a deeper understanding of modern Angola—its people and its politics; past, present and future.Lara Pawson worked for the BBC World Service from 1998 to 2007, reporting from Mali, Ivory Coast and São Tomé and Príncipe. From 1998 to 2000, she was the BBC correspondent in Angola, covering the civil war, and has returned to the country several times since. She currently works as a freelance journalist and lives in London.Irregular WarISIS and the New Threat from the MarginsPaul  RogersIf the rise of Islamic State can overthrow powerful states in a matter of weeks, what kind of a secure future can the world expect? After more than a decade of the war on terror, security specialists thought that Islamist paramilitary movements were in decline; the threat from ISIS in Syria and Iraq, Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Qaida in Yemen, the chaos in Libya and the return of the Taliban in Afghanistan have all shown that to be wishful thinking. Once again the West is at war in the Middle East. Paul Rogers, the distinguished global security specialist, provides a much-needed look at the rise of such global terrorist movements from the margins and presents a new argument as troubling as it is compelling. While Islamic State has taken root in the Middle East and North Africa and has increasing impact across the world as thousands of young men and women rally to its cause, Rogers argues that it should be seen not just as a threat in its own right but as a marker of a much more dangerous world riddled with irregular war.Paul Rogers is Emeritus Professor of Peace Studies at Bradford University and the Global Security Consultant for the Oxford Research Group. He is a leading expert in the field of international security, arms control and political violence with over 30 years' experience.

Following the Conservative victory in the 2015 General Election, the question of 'Brexit'—a British exit from the EU—is high on the political agenda. In this book, former Europe Minister Denis MacShane looks at the history of Britain's fraught relationship with Europe and shows how the possibility of Brexit has become increasingly more likely. He looks at the key personalities who shaped Britain's European policy—from Churchill to Heath and Wilson to Thatcher, Blair and Cameron—and the key issues of immigration and the economy which have heightened Eurosceptic feeling in the UK. Touching on one of the most divisive political issues of our times, this book will be essential reading as Britain, now with its post-election Conservative government, moves towards a referendum on Europe and considers its future place in the world.Denis MacShane was a Labour MP serving in Tony Blair's government as Minister for Europe.Roots and CultureCultural Politics in the Making of Black BritainEddie ChambersHow did a distinct and powerful Black British identity emerge? In the 1950s, when many Caribbean migrants came to Britain, there was no such recognised entity as "Black Britain." Yet by the 1980s, the cultural landscape had radically changed, and a remarkable array of creative practices such as theatre, poetry, literature, music and the visual arts gave voice to striking new articulations of Black-British identity. This new book chronicles the extraordinary blend of social, political and cultural influences from the mid-1950s to late 1970s that gave rise to new heights of Black-British artistic expression in the 1980s. Eddie Chambers relates how and why during these decades "West Indians" became "Afro-Caribbeans," and how in turn "Afro-Caribbeans" became "Black-British"—and the centrality of the arts to this important narrative. The British Empire, migration, Rastafari, the Anti-Apartheid struggle, reggae music, dub poetry, the ascendance of the West Indies cricket team and the coming of Margaret Thatcher—all of these factors, and others, have had a part to play in the compelling story of how the African Diaspora transformed itself to give rise to Black Britain.Eddie Chambers is Associate Professor in the Department of Art and Art History, University of Texas at Austin, where he teaches the art history of the African Diaspora. He gained his Ph.D. from Goldsmiths College, University of London and between 2003 and 2009 he was a Visiting Professor, Art History, at Emory University, Atlanta.

He is the author of Black Artists in British Art: A History since the 1950s.Why Cold War Again?How America Lost Post-Soviet RussiaStephen F. CohenThe new East-West conflict, which broke out over the Ukrainian crisis in 2014, but which long predated it and soon spread through Europe and to the Middle East, is potentially the worst US-Russian confrontation in more than fifty years— and the most fateful. A negotiated resolution is possible, but time may be running out. In this book, renowned Russia scholar and media commentator Stephen F. Cohen traces the history of this East-West relationship in the 'Inter Cold War' period— the years from the purported end of the preceding Cold War, in 1990-1991, to what he has long argued would be a new and even more dangerous Cold War. Cohen's historical and contemporary analysis is insightful, thought-provoking and essential reading for anyone seeking to understand relations between the West and post-Soviet Russia.Stephen F. Cohen is a leading scholar of Russia, media commentator and author of several widely acclaimed books. He is Professor of Russian Studies and History at New York University and Emeritus Professor of Politics at Princeton.

Captain William Gill and his companions, the noted Arabist Professor Edward Palmer of Cambridge University and a young naval lieutenant, Harold Charrington, were killed in an ambush by Bedouin in the Sinai Desert in 1883. The trio had been tasked with informal diplomacy in the region, specifically to prevent the Arab sheikhs from joining the Egyptian rebels and to secure their non-interference with the Suez Canal. The gruesome murders shocked late-Victorian Britain, and led to pressure from the Queen, Parliament and the Press for the British government to launch a manhunt for the killers in a vast desert area, with mountainous terrain. This book traces the story behind the murder of the three men, uncovering the reason for their journey to the desert, the story of the murder itself as well as the backlash back home in England. It shines light on a fascinating, forgotten crime, as well as on early intelligence operations in the Middle EastSaul Kelly is Reader in International History in the Defence Studies Department, King’s College London at the Joint Services Command and Staff College, Shrivenham.

He was the warrior who led the Welsh Revolt and the last war of Welsh independence (1400-1415). He defeated Henry IV's army, was a worthy opponent of the king's champion, the legendary Henry Percy—'Hotspur'—and last native Welshman to bear the title Prince of Wales. He held court at Harlech and envisioned an independent Welsh state and church with national universities. Yet Glyndwr's success was short-lived—his ultimate defeat at the hands of the English saw the final abandonment of the Welsh cause by France and his own disappearance into an unmarked grave. Gideon Brough here provides a new biography of this iconic man—as military leader, diplomat, medieval statesman and staunch Welsh nationalist.Gideon Brough teaches medieval history at the University of Cardiff, from where he holds a PhD. He is a specialist in the medieval history of Europe, with special reference to England and Wales.The Great RivalryGladstone and DisraeliDick LeonardBenjamin Disraeli and William Ewart Gladstone are without doubt the two most iconic figures of Victorian politics. Their distinctly different personalities and policies led to 28 years of bitter political rivalry. For the first time, this book provides the full story of their rivalry and its origins, comparing the upbringing, education and personalities of the two leaders, as well as their political careers. Dick Leonard considers the impact of religion on the two men, their contrasting oratorical skills, their attitudes to political and social reform, foreign affairs and imperialism as well as their relations with Queen Victoria. In their private lives he sheds new light on Gladstone's guilt-ridden obsession with 'reforming' prostitutes, and Disraeli's almost completely successful efforts to conceal the existence of two illegitimate children. Providing important new perspectives on the two towering political characters of the Victorian Age, this book will be essential reading for anyone interested in nineteenth century British history and politics.Dick Leonard is an historian, journalist and author and a former Labour MP. For many years he was Assistant Editor of The Economist, and headed their office in Brussels, where he was later also correspondent of The Observer. He also worked for the BBC, and contributed regularly to leading newspapers across the world.

Beginning as Royal Engineer in the 1870s he would end his career over forty years later as Secretary of State for War—the iconic figure of World War I recruitment posters. In between he became both the most famous British soldier in the world during the peak period of European imperialism, and a celebrated and sometimes controversial pro-consul and administrator. At his death in 1916 he had literally become the 'face' of the British war effort. This new biography offers a timely and modern evaluation of a still disputed and complex military man of empire.C. Brad Faught is Professor of History and Chair of the Department of History at Tyndale University College in Toronto. A graduate of the Universities of Oxford and Toronto, he is a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society and a Senior Fellow of Massey College at the University of Toronto. He is the author of Into Africa: The Imperial Life of Margery Perham; The New A-Z of Empire (both published by I.B.Tauris); The Oxford Movement: A Thematic History of the Tractarians and Their Times and Gordon: Victorian Hero.Being BionicThe World of T.V. CyborgsBronwen CalvertTechnologically-enhanced human bodies can be the stuff of dreams, but also of nightmares. The contradictions and complexities of the cyborg therefore hold particular appeal to programme makers of dramatic TV narratives. Bronwen Calvert examines the uses and representations of the cyborg in this ground-breaking text, by looking at its frequent appearance in a wide variety of popular and cult shows: from the iconic Daleks of Doctor Who and bionic female empowerment in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles, to the duality of humanoid and distinctly robotic cyborgs in Battlestar Galactica. In doing so, she reveals how television's defining traits shape our experience of cyborgs and help us as viewers to question contemporary issues such as surveillance and terrorism, as well as the function of simulation and ultimately what it means to be human.Bronwen Calvert is Associate Lecturer at the Open University in the North of England.There’s No Place Like HomeThe Migrant Child in World CinemaStephanie Hemelryk DonaldThe Wizard of Oz brought many now-iconic tropes into popular culture: the yellow brick road, ruby slippers and Oz. But this book begins with Dorothy and her legacy as an archetypal touchstone in cinema for the child journeying far from home. In There's No Place Like Home, distinguished film scholar Stephanie Hemelryk Donald offers a fresh interpretation of the migrant child as a recurring figure in world cinema. Displaced or placeless children, and the idea of childhood itself, are vehicles to examine migration and cosmopolitanism in films such as Le Ballon Rouge, Sammy Going South and Le Havre. Surveying fictional and documentary film from the post-war years until today, the author shows how the child is a guide to themes of place, self and being in world cinema.Stephanie Hemelryk Donald is Head of the School of Arts at The University of Liverpool. Her research covers film, the media and children’s experiences in the Asia-Pacific region, with a particular focus on visual culture. She is co-editor of Inert Cities: Globalization, Mobility and Suspension in Visual Culture (I.B.Tauris, 2014), among other publications.Hitchcock and the Spy FilmJames ChapmanFilm historian James Chapman has mined Hitchcock's own papers to investigate fully for the first time the spy thrillers of the world's most famous filmmaker. Hitchcock made his name as director of the spy movie. He returned repeatedly to the genre from the British classics of the 1930s, including The 39 Steps and The Lady Vanishes, through wartime Hollywood films Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur to the Cold War tracts North by Northwest, Torn Curtain and his unmade film The Short Night. Chapman's close reading of these films demonstrates the development of Hitchcock's own style as well as how the spy genre as a whole responded to changing political and cultural contexts from the threat of Nazism in the 1930s and 40s to the atom spies and double agents of the post-war world.James Chapman is Professor of Film Studies at the University of Leicester. His previous books for I. B. Tauris include bestsellers Licence To Thrill: A Cultural History of the James Bond Films and Inside the Tardis: The Worlds of 'Doctor Who'—A Cultural History, as well as (with Nicholas J. Cull) Projecting Empire: Imperialism and Popular Cinema and Projecting Tomorrow: Science Fiction and Popular Cinema. He is editor of the Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television.3D WarholThe Sculptural Work of Andy WarholThomas  Morgan EvansRain machines; alarmed kosher pickle jars filled with gemstones; replica cornflakes boxes; 'disco décor'; time capsules; art bombs; birthday presents; perfume bottles and floating silver pillows that are clouds; paintings that are also films; museum interventions; collected and curated projects; expanded performance environments; holograms. This is a book about the vast array of sculptural work made by Andy Warhol between 1954 and 1987, a period that begins long before the first Pop paintings and ends in the year of his death. 3D Warhol brings to the forefront a major, but overlooked aspect of Warhol's oeuvre and provides an essential new perspective on the artist's legacy.Thomas Morgan Evans is a Henry Moore Post-Doctoral Fellow. He has a PhD in art history from UCL. He is an editorial board member of the peer review journal, Object, and contributes to a number of other art publications.Performance ArtA Guided TourPeter BondPresence, immediacy and participation lie at the forefront of some of the most influential art of the past fifty years, yet performance art remains mysterious to many of us. Written for the interested but uninitiated, Performance Art: A Guided Tour offers an accessible guide to the roots, landmarks, and shifting terrain of live art. From its beginnings in conceptual art in the 1950s through the 'media generation' of the 1960s to Marina Abramovic and the live art of today, this book introduces the history and agendas of the medium. Performance art practitioner and scholar Peter Bond explores the origins of performance art and how its effect on us can be usefully interpreted. Through the lenses of art history and performance theory, close studies of artists and thinkers chart the evolution of performance art and provide a critical framework with which to begin to understand our encounters with it. Including a DIY guide to becoming a performance artist, this book locates performance art within shifting circumstances and conflicting discourses, debating different approaches to understanding it. Enlightening and surprising, Performance Art: A Guided Tour enables the reader to navigate the terra incognita of one of the most controversial modern art forms.Peter Bond is Senior Lecturer at Central St. Martin's College of Art and Design and a practising performance artist.Relational ArtA Guided TourCraig SmithTaking place in the skies over London, the plazas of Rotterdam, and the hallways of museums worldwide, a new kind of art has emerged since the 1990s. Known as Relational Art, this controversial practice features audience participation in ways never before realised, often using new media and social networking. In this book, academic and artist Craig Smith outlines a rigorous theory of Relational Art, explaining why audience interaction and collective art production has become so relevant. He traces the movement from its beginnings with the Traffic exhibition and Nicolas Bourriaud's treatise Relational Aesthetics to the diverse and international scope of Relational Art today. Moving through a range of case studies, such as Olafur Eliasson's iconic Weather Project at Tate Modern, this book also reveals how Relational Art has affected the aesthetic, theoretical and economic forces shaping 21st century art. Craig Smith brings together ideas from artists, art critics, curators, philosophers and audience members to illuminate how Relational Art works are conceived, realised and experienced. Through a guided tour of thought-provoking and influential works, he demonstrates that Relational Art has permanently altered the nature of art and its global audiences.Craig Smith is Associate Professor of Art at the College of Fine Arts, University of Florida. His previous books include Training Manual for Relational Art (2009) and On the Subject of the Photographic (2007). He is also a media artist, using image, sound and text to explore the production of contemporary culture.Digital ArtA HistoryNicholas LambertWhat is the story of digital art? Tracing the medium from its roots in constructivist and futurist fantasies to today's complex virtual realities, Nicholas Lambert has written the first rigorous art historical account of digital art's evolution since 1945. Unlike so many artistic developments, digital art has never belonged to a single and canonical movement; its genesis reflects a multiplicity of philosophical viewpoints and technological discoveries. The book chronicles the major artists, exhibitions and institutions key to the medium's story, and explores the revolutionary impact of algorithms, networked mobile devices, immateriality and artificial intelligence on recent art production. This is the defining history of digital art.Nicholas Lambert is Lecturer in Digital Art and Culture at Birkbeck, University of London. He recently completed a major research project with the Victoria & Albert Museum on the history of computer art and technocultures. He is Chair of the Computer Art Society and also develops digital art projects, which have been exhibited in Britain, the United States and elsewhere.George LanceVictorian Master of Still LifeJohn Radcliffe & Mark Lance, Mark LanceGeorge Lance (1802–1864), a pupil of B.R. Haydon, a titanic figure in the Regency art world, brought new vibrancy to still life painting in the early Victorian period. In his seminal work Victorian Painting (1966) Graham Reynolds stated that the revival of still life painting, as an artist's main preoccupation, was effected almost single-handedly by Lance. Over one hundred years earlier J.M.W. Turner had expressed the view that Lance was one of the three greatest colourists of his era. Lavishly illustrated with Lance's works and detailing other aspects of his life, this book gives a rounded picture of the man, not just the artist and will serve as the definitive record of the life of a much under-appreciated painter.John Radcliffe practised as a solicitor in the City of London for the whole of his professional life. He retired in 1997 and has devoted much of the last ten years to research into the life of his forebear, George Lance.Mark Lance, a collateral descendant of the artist, is a Fellow of the Institute of Secretaries and Administrators. He is Managing director of The Cornhill Group Limited. He has also researched deeply into the life and works of George Lance.FlorenceVisions of a CityEdward ChaneyOf all the Italian cities, Florence is one of the best loved and most visited. In this book, Florence's rich and glorious past is vividly brought to life through the medium of letters, diaries, memoirs and commentaries written by travellers from past centuries and by the Florentines themselves. The extracts chosen by Edward Chaney are as rich in variety and colour as the city itself—Boccaccio on the Black Death; Vasari on the building of Giotto's Campanile; an eyewitness account of the installation of Michelangelo's 'David'; the death of Elizabeth Barrett Browning at the Casa Guidi; D.H. Lawrence and Dylan Thomas on twentieth-century Florentine society and many more. With its contemporary illustrations, this book is indispensable for any discerning traveller who wishes not merely to see what is still there but to imagine what was once there; who wants the pleasure of recapturing the drama of the past as vividly as these great writers could hand it down to us; and who above all seeks that indefinable—the true spirit of the place.Edward Chaney is Professor of Fine and Decorative Arts and Chair of the History of Collecting Research Centre at Southampton Solent University. His books include The Jacobean Grand Tour: Early Stuart Travellers in Europe (with Timothy Wilkes, I.B.Tauris); The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion; The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance and The Evolution of English Collecting: Receptions of Italian Art during the Tudor and Stuart Periods.Sicily and the EnlightenmentThe World of Domenico Caracciolo, Thinker and ReformerAngus CampbellDominico Caracciolo was an important figure on the eighteenth-century European stage, holding high office as a diplomat in London, Turin and Paris, and as viceroy and prime minister in the Two Sicilies. He was an inveterate letter-writer and his huge correspondence, with his diplomatic despatches and other official writing, is a unique original source, providing a detailed and vivid picture of the eighteenth-century European elite with all its extravagance and scandalous behaviour but, even more importantly, it is an account of an Enlightenment struggle against the increasingly outdated clerical and feudal rule in Sicily. Caracciolo was an abrasive and combative official and politician and vigorous scion of the Enlightenment. In this book, Angus Campbell provides a detailed portrait of Caracciolo and of the political, social, economic, legal and cultural context in which he lived and worked. In doing so, he provides a unique vantage point on the European diplomatic culture of the eighteenth century.Angus Campbell is an independent researcher, translator and writer.Visitors to VeronaLovers, Gentlemen and AdventurersCaroline WebbEven before the advent of mass tourism, Verona was a popular destination with travellers, including those undertaking the popular 'Grand Tour'Caroline Webb graduated in History from the University of London and read Italian and Art History in Cambridge and Verona.

Rory Maclean, 'Berlin—Imagine a City'. Located at the epicentre of some of modern Europe's most significant and turbulent events, Berlin has long held a magnetic attraction for writers. From 19th century authors recording the city's dramatic transition from Prussian Hauptstadt to German capital after 1871 and the modernist intellectuals of the Weimar period, to the resistance writers brave enough to write during the dark years of the Nazi era and those who captured life on both sides of the divided city, a body of literature has emerged that reveals Berlin's ever-shifting identity. Since 1989, Berlin has yet again become a crucible of creativity, serving as both muse and sanctuary for a new generation of writers who regularly claim it as one of the most exciting cities in the world. This unique and engaging book functions as an introduction to some of the finest writing in and about the city, as well as a guide to some of its best sights and vibrant neighbourhoods. Spanning more than 200 years of local life and literature, it features German authors as diverse as E.T.A. Hoffmann, Joseph Roth, Jörg Fauser, and Christa Wolf, as well as a slew of famous international names such as Mark Twain, Philip Hensher and Chloe Aridjis.Paul Sullivan's journalism and photography work has been published in a variety of international publications including The Guardian, The Sunday Times, BBC Travel and more. He has written and contributed to over a dozen music and travel books for National Geographic, Time Out, Wallpaper, Rough Guides and Fodors, and runs popular Berlin website www.slowtravelberlin.com, through which he publishes Berlin-themed books and runs cultural-historical tours through the city.Marcel Krueger is a writer and translator whose articles and essays have been published in The Daily Telegraph, Süddeutsche Zeitung, CNN Travel, the Matador Network and more, and who also works as a local Berlin expert or 'Spotter' for Spotted by Locals. Marcel divides his time between Berlin, Cologne and Dublin and together with Seamus Heaney, Roddy Doyle and a bunch of other great Irish writers Marcel also holds the world record for 'Most Authors Reading Consecutively From Their Own Books'.ScotlandA Literary Guide for TravellersGarry MacKenzieWith its vibrant cities and breathtaking landscapes, Scotland has captivated writers and visitors for centuries and inspired a diverse range of literature, from the religious poems carved on the rocks of its sacred monuments to the seedy urban novels of Irvine Welsh. For Robert Burns, Scotland's iconic poet, the culture of his native country was a fertile ground for his imagination. Sir Walter Scott drew on the nation's past, and on the stirring mountains and lochs of the Highlands, as he pioneered the historical novel. Some of the most famous early literary tourists, including James Boswell, Samuel Johnson, and Dorothy and William Wordsworth, wrote captivating accounts of their travels in Scotland. This enthralling guide gets under the skin of the country through the writers who lived in or visited Scotland, as well as those who simply imagined it in their work—from Shakespeare, Ben Jonson and the Scots 'Makars' of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, to Keats, Coleridge and Robert Louis Stevenson; from Gaelic bards and anonymous balladeers to the cosmopolitan Hugh MacDiarmid, Jackie Kay, Ian Rankin and Kathleen Jamie. Famous figures sit alongside writers sometimes overlooked by literary travellers, and through their lives and words we experience the rich, fractious and passionate story of Scottish culture and discover how Scotland's history, landscape and society are brought to life in literatureGarry MacKenzie holds a PhD in English from St Andrews, where his supervisors were the Scottish poets Robert Crawford and John Burnside. MacKenzie has also been awarded the Tom Durrheim Prize for ‘exceptional talent in the study of Scottish poetry’ and the St Leonard’s Prize Research Lectures award, through which he gave a series of public lectures based on his PhD researcFlorence And TuscanyA Literary Guide for TravellersTed Jones<DIV><DIV><DIV>The majestic landscapes and rich culture of Tuscany have fostered the inspiration and settings for literature since the works of the Florentine poets Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio in the 14th century and have been a magnet for expatriate writers since the arrival in Florence of the English poet Geoffrey Chaucer in 1372. With its historic cities and villages, its countryside and coastline, its treasury of art covering five millennia and, above all, its long heritage of authorship, Tuscany is one of the most celebrated and well-travelled regions in the world.  As the source of the Italian language and birthplace of the Renaissance, this region lies at the cultural heart of Italy and has been irresistible to writers for six centuries.  </DIV><DIV> </DIV><DIV><I>Florence and Tuscany: A Literary Guide for Travellers</I> takes the literary-minded traveller (either in person or in an armchair) on a vivid and illuminating journey, retracing the footsteps of writers who have lived and worked in, or been inspired by, the history and landscape of Tuscany, from John Milton and Thomas Gray, to the Brownings, the Shelleys, Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, Ezra Pound, Charles Dickens, D.H.

A bounty prized by invaders from the Greeks, Romans, and Vandals to the Byzantines, Arabs, and Normans, Sicily’s violently beautiful landscapes are haunted by a vibrant mix of cultures, and her soil has always been fertile ground for the literary and artistic imagination. This compelling guide uncovers the island’s multifaceted personality through the experiences of those literary figures who have managed to get under her skin, including Pindar, Cicero, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Cervantes, DH Lawrence, Coleridge, Oscar Wilde, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Ezra Pound, and Lawrence Durrell; as well as local writers who have defined the modern Italian novel, including Giuseppe di Lampedusa and Leonardo Sciascia.

"Perhaps I am afraid of losing Venice all at once, if I speak of it, or perhaps, speaking of other cities, I have already lost it, little by little."Italo Calvino, Invisible CitiesVenice, 'La Serenissima, is one of the most breathtaking cities in the world. A floating labyrinth; the world's greatest museum, frozen in time; a cultural jewel, slowly sinking into the lagoon from which it rose; tourist-trap, irresistible muse. From its earliest beginings in the 7th century, Venice has been a magnetic centre of trade and culture, wealth and power and has acted as a crossroads for an array of religious pilgrims and refugees, diplomats, crusading armies and merchants. Later, its fabled beauty and reputation as a haven for freedom of expression seduced some of the most celebrated figures in history: artists such as Dürer, Da Vinci, Bellini and Turner; writers Dickens, Byron, Kafka, Poe, Rousseau, Thomas Mann, Ruskin and Ezra Pound and composers Mozart, Tchaikovsky, Verdi and Stravinsky. In this, the first literary guide to Venice, the author uncovers the city's myriad secrets, revealing how every floating palace, gilded church and bustling square is imbued with the lives and creations of those who were inspired by the city, which still echoes with their voices.Marie-José Gransard teaches a course, 'Venice in Literature', in Cannaregio and conducts tours of the city. She has worked with Hilary Spurling on her biography of Matisse and with Anthony Holden for his biography of Lorenzo da Ponte. She divides her time between Venice and London.The Tangier DiariesJohn Hopkins"Tangier, the white city poised atop the dark continent which turns out to be the continent of light."Tangier in the '60s and '70s was a fabled place. This edge city, the "Interzone," became muse and escapist's dream for artists, writers, millionaires and socialites, who wrote, painted, partied and experienced life with an intensity and freedom that they never could back home. Into this louche and cosmopolitan world came John Hopkins, a young writer who instantly became a part of the bohemian Tangier crowd with its core of Beats that included William Burroughs, Paul and Jane Bowles and Brion Gysin, as well as Tennessee Williams, Jean Genet, Yves Saint Laurent, Barbara Hutton and Malcolm Forbes. Those intoxicating decades–Tangier's 'Golden Years'–are long gone. Grand old houses that once sparkled with life are shuttered and dark and most of the eccentrics who once lived and loved in the city have died. But here, in the pages of Hopkins' cult classic, all the decadence and flamboyance of those days is brought to life once more.John Hopkins is a writer who, after graduating from Princeton, lived for many years in Tangier and was a central figure in the bohemian literary crowd of the '60s and '70s.The French RivieraA Literary Guide for TravellersTed Jones<div><div><i>The French Riviera: A Literary Guide for Travellers</i> is a reader's journey along the fabled coast which has provided the inspiration and setting for some of the greatest literature of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

LawrenceIn 1922, his dreams of an independent Arabia shattered, T.E. Lawrence enlisted in the RAF under the assumed name John Hume Ross. Though methodical and restrictive, life there seemed to suit Lawrence: "The Air Force is not a man-crushing humiliating slavery, all its days. There is sun & decent treatment, and a very real measure of happiness, to those who do not look forward or back." With poetic clarity, Lawrence brings to life the harsh realities of barracks life and illuminates the strange twilight world he had slipped into after his war experiences. For anyone interested in the life of one of the 20th century's most enduring heroes and his life beyond the well-documented Arab revolt, The Mint is essential and compelling reading.Thomas Edward Lawrence was born in 1888. Educated at Oxford, he was later made a research fellow of All Souls College. During the First World War he was attached to the Hejaz Expeditionary Force and later transferred to General Allenby's staff. In 1921 he became Advisor on Arab Affairs in the Colonial Office. In 1927, uncomfortable with his 'Lawrence of Arabia' legend, Lawrence joined the RAF. He was killed in a motobike accident in 1935 at the age of 47. Author of the classic Seven Pillars of Wisdom and its abridged version, Revolt in the Desert (Tauris Parke Paperbacks), Lawrence also wrote a prose translation of Homer's Odyssey.Priam’s GoldSchliemann and the Lost Treasures of TroyCaroline MooreheadTroy: one of the most captivating and mysterious stories of antiquity… But was Troy an actual place or just a legend of Homer's epic? It took the most unlikely of people, Heinrich Schliemann—a grocer's-apprentice turned self-made archaeologist, courageous and driven—to solve one of the greatest puzzles in history. His extraordinary discovery of the ruins of fabled Troy and the magnificent treasure of King Priam anointed Schliemann as the 'father of pre-history', but was also beset by controversy that persists to this day. The fate of the treasure itself is no less troubled. In 1945 it was spirited out of Berlin by the Red Army, to be hidden for 50 years in the vaults of the Pushkin Museum until the breakup of the Soviet Union. In this fast-paced account, Caroline Moorehead describes one of the most remarkable adventures of the 20th century, tracing Schliemann's footsteps to Troy and the convoluted journey across Europe taken by the treasure itself.Caroline Moorehead, a biographer and historian, has written biographies of Bertrand Russell, Martha Gelhorn, Freya Stark and Iris Origo; as well as several non-fiction works, including Human Cargo, on refugees in the modern world, and Hostages to Fortune, a work on terrorism. Most recently, she has written two acclaimed histories centred in Occupied France during World War II: A Train in Winter and Village of Secrets. She was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1993 and awarded an OBE in 2005 for services to literature.SyriaThe Desert and the SownGertrude Bell<P>"You may rely upon one thing — I'll never engage in creating kings again; it's too great a strain."</P><P>Gertrude Bell - traveller, scholar, archaeologist, spy - was one of the most powerful figures in the Middle East in the 20th century. With T.E. Lawrence, she was a significant force behind the Arab Revolt and was responsible for creating the boundaries of the modern state of Iraq, as well as installing the Hashemite dynasty, with Faisal I as king, in Iraq and Transjordan. Her knowledge of the Arab world was forged through decades of travel and the relationships she built across Arabia with tribal leaders and kings, who referred to her as Umm al Mu'mineen, or Mother of the Faithful. In the winter of 1906, she undertook an often dangerous journey through Greater Syria - Damascus, Jerusalem, Beirut, Antioch and Alexandretta - and her portrait of the landscapes, people and customs of a part of the world that very few had explored at the time is now a classic of travel writing. Bell's Syria illuminates a region that continues to preoccupy us today as well as portraying the unique life of a remarkable, still-controversial and ultimately tragic woman.<BR></P>Gertrude Bell, CBE (1868-1926), ''the Queen of the Desert'', was one of Oxford University's most brilliant students and the greatest female mountaineer of her time. She was also a writer, traveler, political officer, archeologist and spy who helped forge the boundaries of the modern Middle East.Vanessa BellPortrait of a Bloomsbury ArtistFrances SpaldingVanessa Bell is central to the history of the Bloomsbury Group, yet she has largely remained a silent and inscrutable figure. Tantalizing glimpses of her life appeared mainly in her sister, Virginia Woolf's, letters, diaries and biography. Spalding draws upon a mass of unpublished documents to reveal Bell's extraordinary achievements in both her art and her life. She recounts in vivid detail how Bell's move into the Bloomsbury Group and her exposure to Paris and the radical art of the Post-Impressionists ran parrallel with an increasingly unorthodox personal life, from her marriage to Clive Bell and her affair with Roger Fry, to her friendship with Duncan Grant, and her relationship with her sister.Frances Spalding is an art historian, critic and biographer, and a leading authority of Bloomsbury.Army of the NightThe Life and Death of Jean Moulin, Legend of the French ResistancePatrick MarnhamWho was the enigmatic Jean Moulin, a man as skilled in deception as he was in acts of heroism? The memory of this French Resistance hero, who was betrayed to the Gestapo and tortured to death by Klaus Barbie, the infamous ''Butcher of Lyon'', is revered alongside Voltaire and Victor Hugo. But Moulin's story is full of unanswered questions, and the truth of his life is far more complicated than the legend. Patrick Marnham, winner of the Marsh Prize for Biography, thrillingly tells the epic story of France's greatest war hero.Patrick Marnham is a journalist and author. He has been Paris correspondent for The Independent, a reporter for Private Eye and Literary Editor of The Spectator.Ernest HemingwayAnthony Burgess, Patrick MarnhamErnest Hemingway was 'a man who lived it up to write it down' and his life became the root from which his novels grew. At the age of 18 he was awarded a medal for bravery in the First World War; he honed his literary craft in 1920s Paris; his macho image grew with his love of big-game hunting, deep-sea fishing and bull-fighting and was cemented during the Spanish Civil War, when he survived the bombardment of Madrid. But, by the 1940s, the darkness of his alcoholism and violent rages began to weigh heavily. Hemingway had become the patriarch of American literature but he was plagued by unrelenting demons and an insidious disenchantment with life. In this unflinching portrait, Anthony Burgess explores Hemingway's fatal contradictions: his arrogance and self-doubt, his machismo and vulnerability. He reveals a man who was as much a creation as his books yet who, even at his worst, reminds us that to engage literature one has first to engage life.Anthony Burgess (1917-1993) was a novelist, poet, playwright, composer, linguist, translator and critic. He is best known for his novel, A Clockwork Orange, but altogether he wrote thirty-three novles, twenty-five works of non-fiction, two volumes of autobiography, three symphonies, more than 150 other musical works and reams of journalism in his role as longtime literary critic for The Observer and The Guardian.<P>Patrick Marnham is a journalist and author, whose books include So Far from God (winner of the Thomas Cook Prize), The Man who Wasn't Maigret (winner of the Marsh Prize for Biography and an Edgar Allen Poe finalist), Dreaming with his Eyes Open: A Life of Diego Rivera and Road to Katmandu (Tauris Parke Paperbacks).

<i>—The New Yorker</i><br></p><div></div>Freya Stark (1893-1993), ""the poet of travel,"" was the doyenne of Middle East writers and one of the most courageous and adventurous female travelers in history. She explored Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, and Southern Arabia, where she became the first Western woman to journey through the Hadhramaut. Usually solo, she ventured to places few Europeans had ever been. She received the title of Dame and her many, now classic, books include <i>Travels in the Near East, A Winter in Arabia, The Southern Gates of Arabia, Alexander's Path, Dust in the Lion's Paw, East is West, </i>and <i>Valleys of the Assassins</i>.News from TartaryAn Epic Journey Across Central AsiaPeter Fleming<DIV></DIV><I>News from Tartary</I> describes a phenomenally successful attempt that legendary adventurer Peter Fleming made to travel overland from Peking to Kashmir. The journey took seven months and covered about 3,500 miles. and Motivated largely by curiosity, he set out with his companion Ella Maillart across a China torn by civil war to journey through Xinjiang to British India. It had been eight years since anyone had crossed Xinjiang; in between those who had entered this inhospitable and politically volatile area—under the control of a warlord supported by Stalin's Red Army—seldom left alive. Entering the province by a little known route and following the path of the Silk Road, they ended up in Kashgar before crossing the Pamirs to India. Beautifully written and superbly observed, this is not simply an account of a part of the world few of us will ever see, but also a marvellous insight into the last days of the Great Game, when Britain and Russia still faced each other across a Central Asia in a state of anarchy.<DIV></DIV>Peter Fleming, OBE, (1907-1971) was a journalist and writer and one of the last great adventurers of the twentieth century. He began his career as a special correspondent with <I>The Times</I> and later wrote for <I>The Spectator</I>. He served with the Grenadier Guards during World War II and from 1942 was in charge of military deception operations in Southeast Asia.

Forster (1879-1970) was perhaps the most quintessential of English novelists.

But as the procession of people flies past you, you will realize what a gulf lies between you. The East looks to itself; it knows nothing of the greater world of which you are a citizen, asks nothing of you and your civilization.'" <br>This brilliant, vivid and impressionistic series of sketches, formed during her 1892 stay in Persia, is Gertrude Bell's first published work. Infused with a distinctive orientalism, " Persian Pictures" is an evocative, virtuosic meditation, moving sinuously between Persia's heroic, complex, mythical past and its present decline; the public face of Tehran and the otherworldly 'secret, mysterious life of the East', the lives of its women, its enclosed, quasi-medieval gardens; from the bustling cities to the lonely wastelands of Khorasan. Bell's documentation of Muharram - the month of mourning for Imam Hussein, the grandson of the Prophet Mohammed - and Ramadan, display a mind finely attuned to the differences and similarities between Islam and Christianity, East and West." Persian Pictures" is both travelogue and meditation, an elegiac and beautifully observed account of a spellbinding land.<div class="emptyClear"></div></div><div class="seeAll"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/product-description/1780766920/ref=dp_proddesc_0?ie=UTF8&isInIframe=1&n=283155&s=books">See all Editorial Reviews</a></div><div></div>Gertrude Bell, CBE (1868–1926) was a writer, traveler, political officer, archaeologist, and spy who traveled extensively throughout Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Arabia. Along with T.E. Lawrence, Bell helped establish the Hashemite dynasties in what is today Jordan as well as in Iraq. She played a major role in establishing and helping administer the modern state of Iraq, using the perspective gained from her travels and relations with tribal leaders in the Middle East.Love in BloomsburyFrances Partridge<DIV></DIV>The Bloomsbury Group was as well known for its love affairs as for the work that was produced by its members. Of all the romantic entanglements, the love quadrangle between Frances Partridge, her husband Ralph Partridge, his first wife, Dora, and Lytton Strachey was one of the most notorious (Frances loved Ralph, who loved Dora, who loved Lytton, who loved Ralph) and tragic, ending in the death of Strachey and the suicide of Dora. <I>Love in Bloomsbury</I>, Frances Partridge’s celebrated memoirs, describes her Victorian  upbringing  and tells the story of the star-crossed quartet, two of whom were doomed, the other two survivors. Replete with vivid accounts of parties  and infused with the heady, Bohemian  atmosphere which flourished after the First World War and revealing character sketches of all the principal “Bloomsberries”—Leonard and Virginia Woolf, her sister Vanessa Bell, John Maynard Keynes and Roger Fry. This is Bloomsbury laid bare—a window  onto the lives, loves, and excesses of some of the twentieth century’s most intriguing, yet enigmatic, players.<DIV></DIV><P>Frances Partridge, CBE (1900-2004), was “the last survivor” of the Bloomsbury Group and the author of memoirs and diaries such as <I>A Pacifist’s War</I>, <I>Julia</I>, <I>Nothing to Lose</I>, and <I>Hanging On</I>, among many others.Edward LearA LifePeter Levi, Robin Hanbury-Tenison<p><span>Edward Lear was an English eccentric and an admirable poet whose nonsense verse has endeared him to generations of Americans.

Escaping the furor that surrounded the publication of his controversial book on Hitler, while in Morocco, Lewis explored the culture of the Berbers of Morocco. In <I>Journey into Barbary</I>, Lewis provides a first-hand look into the people and culture of the region. While uncomfortable and direct at times, Lewis goes beyond the typical stereotypes of the Berber people and produces a book unlike any other for this period. <I>Journey into Barbary</I> is a unique look of Morocco in the 1930s as well as of Europe’s involvement and attitudes toward the region.<DIV></DIV><DIV>Wyndham Lewis (1882-1957) was a painter, co-founder of the Vorticist Movement, and writer. His most well-known novels include <I>The Revenge for</I> <I>Love and Tarr,</I> as well as a major work of fiction, <I>The Human Age</I>. He served in France during World War I and his subsequent paintings of war earned him a place as one of the early twentieth century's most dynamic artists.</DIV>Perseus In The WindA Life of TravelFreya Stark<DIV><DIV><P></P><P></P>Written just after World War II, <I>Perseus in the Wind</I> (named after the constellation) is perhaps the most personal, and haunting, of all Freya Stark's writings. Putting together memories and reflections, ""harvested from life and accident"", that have carried her through her travels, Stark muses on the seasons, the effect light has on a landscape at a particular time of day, the smell of the earth after rain, Muslim saints, Indian temples, war, and old age. Each chapter is devoted to a particular theme: Happiness (simple pleasures, like her father's passion for the view from his cabin in Canada); Education (to be able to command happiness, recognize beauty, value death, increase enjoyment); Beauty (incongruous, flighty, and elusive - a description of the stars, the burst of flowers in a park); Death (a childhood awareness of the finality of Time, the meaningfulness of the end); Memory (the jeweled quality of literature, pleasure, love, an echo or a scent when aged by the passage of time). <P></P><P></P>Woven throughout this beautifully-crafted book are references to Stark's many travels, from Asolo to Aden, Iran to India. For those who have loved her travel writing, <I>Perseus in the Wind</I> illuminates the motivations behind her journeys and the woman behind the traveler. <P></P></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV>Freya Stark (1893-1993), ""the poet of travel"", was the doyenne of Middle East writers and one of the most courageous and adventurous female travellers in history.

America's favorite adventure writer dined with, Haile Selassie and rode the Rhinocerous Express in Ethiopia, had an audience with King Ibn Saud outside the gates of Mecca (which he had tried to sneak into), and finally rode an elephant over the Alps, following the tracks of Hannibal. This is Halliburton at his best, reckless and romantic, and it is the last chapter of a life grown tragic. Nearing 40, physically exhausted, and in financial trouble, Halliburton thought to roll the dice once again, hoping that the charm that had always saved him in the past would materialize one more time. Soon after finishing this book, he embarked on his last, fatal, journey.</DIV></DIV><DIV><P>Richard Halliburton (1900-1939) was America's great adventurer and one of the most successful adventure travel writers of the twentieth century. Through a life spent chasing horizons and concocting ever more daring schemes - from swimming the length of the Panama Canal to flying around the world in an open cockpit plane to crossing the Alps on an elephant - Halliburton dazzled the western world. His final adventure, sailing a junk across the Pacific, was also his last. Halliburton disappeared in March 1939 and was never seen again. His wild adventures live on in the books that have captivated millions of readers and inspired generations of writers. </DIV>Elizabeth and EssexA Tragic HistoryLytton  StracheyOne of the most famous and tortured romances in history—between Elizabeth I, Queen of England, and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex—began in 1587, when she was fifty-three and he was nineteen. Their passionate affair continued for five years, until Essex was beheaded for treason in 1601. In a fast-paced succession of brilliantly-rendered scenes, Lytton Strachey portrays Elizabeth and Essex's compelling attraction for each other, their impassioned disagreements and their mutual struggle for power, which culminated so tragically—for both of them. Alongside the doomed love affair, Strachey pins colourful portraits of the leading characters and influential figures of the time: Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, Robert Cecil and other members of her glittering court who fought to assert themselves in a kingdom and a country defined by Elizabeth's incomparable reign. Lytton Strachey here illuminates, in spellbinding prose, one of the most poignant affairs in history alongside the glamour and intrigue of the Elizabethan era.Lytton Strachey (1880-1932), one of the most famous writers of his time, was a prominent member of the Bloomsbury Set and pioneer of a new style of biography. Author of, among others, 'Landmarks', 'Eminent Victorians' and 'Queen Victoria' (also Tauris Parke Paperbacks).HoraceA LifePeter Levi<DIV><DIV>The work of the great Roman poet, Horatius Flaccus (65 BC to 8 BC), spanned all aspects of Roman life—politics, the arts, religion, and the authority of the emperor—while his legendary poems ( <I>Satires, Odes, Epistles </I>) about friendship, philosophy, love, and sex still have considerable appeal. This biography presents a complete picture of Horace's life and world. It considers the details of Horace's romantic liaisons and why he never married, what the status of his father—a freedman—meant to the poet, and his distinctive brand of philosophy. In this acclaimed biography, Peter Levi, a fellow poet, has produced a thrilling and eminently readable book, the definitive account of Rome's greatest poet and the times during which he lived.</DIV></DIV><DIV></DIV><P>Peter Levi, FSA, FRSL, (1931-2000) was a poet, archaeologist, Jesuit priest, travel writer, scholar, biographer, and critic.

Along the long frontier of the Euphrates in Turkey lay the easternmost limits of the Roman Empire—a region they called Augusta Euphrantentis. Their expanding involvement lasted eight centuries, draining their energies and culminating in the destruction of the bridge that, since the time of Alexander the Great, had linked China to the commerce of the Mediterranean. Tracing the path of this ancient river and highlighting her travels with the vibrant history of 800 years of Roman warfare and the history of this mighty river, Freya Stark ultimately reveals the futility of war, of arbitrary boundaries, and territorial conquest. Rome on the Euphrates, at once travel and history, is one of her most magnificent and highly acclaimed works.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Freya Stark (1893-1993), *the poet of travel,* was the doyenne of Middle East travel writers and one of the most courageous and adventurous female travelers in history. She traveled extensively through Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, and Southern Arabia, where she became the first western woman to travel through the Hadhramaut.

The journey took him from the dark woods of Puritan New England to neo-Nazi cults in the Rockies; from Mormons and snake handlers to fundamentalist groups who challenge the teaching of evolution; from channelers in California to the sexual and financial scandals surrounding millionaire TV preachers. <I>The Divine Supermarket </I>is his quirky and brilliantly-observed account of the journey, offering illuminating and humorous insights into the baffling soul of modern America.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Malise Ruthven is a writer and historian of the Islamic world, with a focus on religious fundamentalism. He has been a scriptwriter with the BBC Arabic and World Services, and has taught Islamic Studies and Comparative Religion at the University of Aberdeen, the University of California, and at Dartmouth. He is a frequent contributor to <I>The New York Review of Books</I>, among other publications, and is the author of several other books, including <I>Fury for God and Fundamentalism</I>. </DIV>Bayonets to LhasaFrancis Younghusband and The British Invasion of TibetPeter Fleming<DIV><DIV>The British invasion of Tibet in 1904 is one of the strangest events in British imperial history. Planned by Lord Curzon as a strategic move in the Great Game, the incursion was in fact ill-conceived and inspired by only the weakest of motivations. Led by the soldier, explorer, and mystic Francis Younghusband, the mission—doomed from the very beginning—became caught in political cross-fire and the distant and destructive machinations of China and England and ended in ignominy and disappointment. Peter Fleming's Bayonets to Lhasa is a gripping depiction of this unusual chain of events, its charismatic protagonists, and the repercussions that continue to be felt throughout the region.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Peter Fleming (1907–1971), was a journalist and writer and one of the last great adventurers of the twentieth century. He began his career as a special correspondent with <I>The Times (London), </I>and later wrote for <I>The Spectator</I>.

He thought that there, anything he found would have no relevance to the European art that he had so compulsively “stitched in to the dense fabric of my art-historical memory” and that he could therefore enjoy the art for its own sake. But Turkey surprised him, and he delighted in the unexpected wealth of Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic cultures there, returning three of four times a year until 1990. The bulk of this book focuses on his journey from Ephesus to Side one winter. With typically acerbic commentary, Sewell describes (not always favorably) the archaeological and historical sites he comes across, the landscapes that so clearly thrill him, the encounters he has along the way, and the fractious, though wonderfully funny, relationship he forms with Ayhan, his driver. This is a book that could only have been written by Sewell and has become a quirky classic of travel literature.</DIV></DIV><DIV><B>Brian Sewell</B> is one of the most recognizable names in art criticism today: discerning, often controversial, and--without fail--entertaining and informative. He appears regularly on TV and radio and is the art critic of the <I>Evening Standard</I>.<BR></DIV>Queen VictoriaA LifeLytton Strachey<DIV><DIV>Lytton Strachey's acclaimed portrayal of Queen Victoria revolutionized the art of biography by using elements of romantic fiction and melodrama to create a warm, humorous, and very human portrait of this iconic figure. We see Victoria as a strong-willed child with a famous temper, as the 18-year-old girl queen, as a monarch, wife, mother, and widow. Equally fascinating are the depictions of her relationships: with her governess “precious Lehzen,” with Peel, Gladstone, and Disraeli, with her beloved Albert, and, in later life, her legendary devotion to her Highland servant John Brown, all of which show a different side of the staid, pious image that is so often attached to her.</DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV>Lytton Strachey (1880–1932), one of the most famous writers of his time, was a prominent member of the Bloomsbury set and pioneer of a new style of biography. He is the author of, among others <I>Landmarks</I>, <I>Eminent Victorians,</I> and <I>Elizabeth and Essex.</I></DIV></DIV>VirgilA LifePeter Levi<DIV><DIV>Born in 70 BC, in a small village near Mantua, Publius Vergilius Maro—Virgil—grew up to be hailed as the greatest Roman poet. And although his work has influenced Western literature for two millennia, little is known about the man himself. Who was the man who created the Aeneid—one of the most important poems in Western literature—and such universal phrases as “love conquers all” and “fortune favors the bold?” Peter Levi here reconstructs the poet's life, from a childhood largely shrouded in mystery to his work as a great literary genius and revolutionary poet, by examining archaeological and historical evidence from Augustan Rome, as well as through close readings of the poet's own work. “Virgil is an intensely personal poet, yet he is anonymous . . . My aim is not so ambitious as to try and restore his prestige single-handed. It has simply been to try to understand him in his original context.” In this highly acclaimed, nowclassic biography, Peter Levi discards the myths and brilliantly reveals the life of Virgil and the extraordinary times during which he lived.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Peter Levi, FSA, FRSL, (1931—2000) was a poet, archaeologist, Jesuit priest, travel writer, scholar, biographer, and critic.

Chancellor of the Exchequer and a powerful and popular orator, leadership of the Conservative Party seemed within his grasp. A year later, however, all had changed. The Conservatives were defeated, and when a National Government was formed in 1931, Churchill was not asked to join it. Though he was a lone figure from this point, his acute political sense, foresight, and courage were undiminished. Fed with secret inside information by a group of brave men, Churchill consistently warned of the Nazi danger, even before the rise of Hitler. The government fought him at every turn, even refusing him the right to broadcast. But he never gave up. It was as a direct result of his brave perseverance that the British public came to realize the truth of his warnings—a bond formed that would be so vital in the years to come.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Sir Martin Gilbert</B> is Winston Churchill's official biographer and a leading historian of the modern world.

His mother had died a few months earlier and a single obsession had risen from his grief: the notion to build a feather-light flying machine. And so, on the island where Daedalus and Icarus had made man’s maiden flight, MacLean journeyed back to beginnings, back into the Greek myths, and—with the help of his Cretan neighbors and plenty of wine—built a plane and tried to fly.</P><P></P><P>Falling for Icarus is at once a meditation on love, a celebration of the passion for flight, and a hilarious, vivid portrait of a village. Its generous and exhilarating characters restore MacLean’s faith in life. Through them, he tells a soaring, moving story about how a dream can transform sadness.</P></DIV><BR></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Rory MacLean</B> is a writer, broadcaster, blogger, and fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His eight books, including UK bestsellers <I>Stalin's Nose</I> and <I>Under the Dragon</I>, have challenged and invigorated travel writing and, according to the late John Fowles, are among works that “marvellously explain why literature still lives.” He has won awards from the Canada Council and the Arts Council of England as well as a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship, and was nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary prize. He has written and presented over 50 BBC radio programs and worked on movies with Marlene Dietrich and David Bowie.

But who was the man behind the carefully constructed mask? </P><P>Self-indulgent and ruthless, sybaritic and brutal, egotistical yet capable of self-effacement, weak-willed yet fiercely calculating, Goering was a contradictory, complex, and often buffoonish character. In this classic biography, Richard Overy takes the reader on a chilling journey into the heart of Hitler’s inner circle. He illuminates the many facets of Goering’s personality and charts his story from his golden days as Hitler’s most trusted commander to his failures and loss of power after the Battle of Britain, his sensational trial at Nuremberg, and his ignominious death by suicide on the eve of his execution.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Richard Overy's</B> award-winning writing on the history of World War II and the Third Reich has been praised as *highly effective in the ruthless dispelling of myths* (A.

G. H. James<DIV>In November 1922, a momentous discovery - unlike any other before or since - was to change our understanding of the ancient world. Until now, however, the marvelous story of Carter's quest for Tutankhamun and its culmination in his unearthing of the intact, treasure-filled tomb has been told without a reliable account of the man behind the discovery and the myths that have surrounded it. Howard Carter's career was a remarkable one: he had arrived in Egypt 30 years earlier as a 17-year old ""tracer"" with rudimentary education, and progressed to become the first Chief Inspector of Antiquities in Upper Egypt. An improbable but auspicious partnership with the 5th Earl of Carnarvon developed in which the young Carter acted as assistant and ""learned man"" to the aristocrat's excavations in the Theban necropolis. But it was the legendary discovery in the Valley of the Kings and Carter's painstaking clearance of the intact royal burial that was to secure his place in history. He became an international celebrity, simultaneously honored and vilified wherever he went, but he was also a sad, disillusioned man whose success never brought any reward of happiness. T.G.H. James' definitive biography is both the story of perhaps the most renowned archaeologist of all time and of an essentially tragic human being.</DIV><DIV>T.G.H.

For Halliburton, it was the ultimate in romantic, risky exploration and was a means of seeing the world in a way that few had ever seen it before. True to form, his journey was breathtakingly audacious. They performed aerobatics in Fez; landed in mysterious Timbuktu; spent time with the French Foreign Legion in Algeria; and explored Cairo, Damascus, and Petra. In India, they flew over the Taj Mahal—upside down—and, soaring over the Himalayas, Halliburton took the first aerial photograph of Everest. A journey as dazzling as Halliburton himself and, with the world at war less than a decade later, marking the end of an era, the story of The Flying Carpet is as captivating today as it was to the world 80 years ago.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Richard Halliburton</B> (1900-1939) was America's greatest adventurer and one of the most successful adventure travel writers of the 20th century.

A detachment of German soldiers arrive in a rural French town, hunting down resistance fighters, many of whom are hiding in the region. More than sixty years later, the villagers clearly remember the day when four peasants from a nearby village were taken hostage and shot as an example to others. But do they remember the whole story? Jean-Marie Borzeix sets out to investigate the events of Holy Thursday 1944, and to reveal the hidden truths of that fateful day. He uncovers the story of a mysterious 'fifth man' shot alongside the resisters and eventually unravels a trail which leads him to Paris, Israel and into the darkest corners of the Holocaust in France. A captivating story, the events of this day in a small, entirely typical, town illuminate the true impact of World War II in France.Jean-Marie Borzeix is a journalist, writer and broadcaster. He began his career as a reporter writing for Combat and the Quotidien de Paris before becoming editor-in-chief of Nouvelles Littéraires and literary editor for Editions du Seuil.

Yet some organisations are succeeding. Why are organisations such as Vice and BuzzFeed investing in journalism and why are pedigree journalists joining them? Why are news organisations making journalists redundant but recruiting technologists? Why does everyone seem to be embracing native advertising? Why are some news organisations more innovative than others? Drawing on extensive first-hand research this book explains how different international media organisations approach digital news and pinpoints the common organisational factors that help build their success.Lucy Küng is a Research Fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford.

The two professions have vied with each other for primacy: journalists could open or close the gates, but PR had the stories, the contacts and often the budgets for extravagant campaigns. The arrival of the internet, and especially of social media, has changed much of that. These new technologies have turned the audience into players – who play an important part in making the reputation, and the brand, of everyone from heads of state to new car models vulnerable to viral tweets and social media attacks. Companies, parties and governments are seeking more protection – especially since individuals within these organisations can themselves damage, even destroy, their brand or reputation with an ill-chosen remark or an appearance of arrogance. The pressures, and the possibilities, of the digital age have given public figures and institutions both a necessity to protect themselves, and channels to promote themselves free of news media gatekeepers. Political and corporate communications professionals have become more essential, and more influential within the top echelons of business, politics and other institutions. Companies and governments can now – must now – become media themselves, putting out a message 24/7, establishing channels of their own, creating content to attract audiences and reaching out to their networks to involve them in their strategies Journalism is being brought into these new, more influential and fast growing communications strategies. And, as newspapers struggle to stay alive, journalists must adapt to a world where old barriers are being smashed and new relationships built – this time with public relations in the driving seat. The world being created is at once more protected and more transparent; the communicators are at once more influential and more fragile.

Although there have been considerable changes in the prospects for women working in the media in the past few decades, women are still noticeably in the minority in the top journalistic roles, despite making up the majority of journalism students. In this book, Suzanne Franks looks at the key issues surrounding female journalists – from on-screen sexism and ageism to the dangers facing female foreign correspondents reporting from war zones. She also analyses the way that the changing digital media have presented both challenges and opportunities for women working in journalism and considers this in an international perspective. In doing so, this book provides an overview of the ongoing imbalances faced by women in the media and looks at the key issues hindering gender equality in journalism.</DIV><DIV>Suzanne Franks is Professor of Journalism at City University London.

Some researchers have argued that stressing the 'risks' posed by climate change rather than the 'uncertainties' can create a more helpful context for policy makers and a stronger response from the public. However, understanding the concepts of risk and uncertainty – and how to communicate them – is a hotly debated issue. In this book, James Painter analyses how the international media present these and other narratives surrounding climate change. He focuses on the coverage of reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and of the melting ice of the Arctic Sea, and includes six countries: Australia, France, India, Norway, the UK and the USA.</DIV><DIV>James Painter is Head of the Journalism Fellowship Programme at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Oxford University, UK.

PicardThe vulnerability of journalists to kidnappings was starkly illustrated by the killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff by Islamic militants in 2014. Their murder underscored the risks taken by journalists and news organisations trying to cover developments in dangerous regions of the world and has forced news enterprises to more clearly prepare for and confront issues of safety. This book explores the complex organisational issues surrounding the capture or kidnapping of journalists in areas of conflict and risk. It explores how journalists 'becoming news' is covered and the implications of that coverage, how news organisations prepare for and respond to such events, and how kidnapping and ransom insurers, victim recovery firms, journalists' families, and governments influence the actions of news enterprises. It considers how and why journalists are kidnapped, how employers and journalists' organisations respond to kidnappings and why freelancers are particularly at risk as well as suggesting best practices for preventing and responding to kidnappings.Robert G. Picard is Director of Research at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism in the Department of Politics and International Relations at University of Oxford, a research fellow at Green Templeton College (Oxford) and a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts.Religion in the Roman WorldGods, Myth and Magic in Ancient RomeJuliette HarrissonThe Romans had a persisting and voracious appetite for myth, magic and ritual. They invoked the local gods to rain down punishment on adulterers or thieves. They burned fragrant resin for the protecting deities of hearth and home. They sacrificed at temples to bring glory to the divine person of the emperor. And they conducted secret rites of initiation into cults like those devoted to Isis, Cybele, Dionysus and Mithras. Juliette Harrisson shows ancient Rome to have been a hive of religious experimentation. In her new and comprehensive survey, she takes her readers from the turmoil of the Late Republic to the high point of imperial rule (133 BC-AD 235), thereby exploring the many facets of religiosity in the Roman world. She examines, among other topics, worship of the state-sanctioned Olympian gods and the role of religion in Roman politics; the impact of 'mystery cults' focused on Greek, Near Eastern and Egyptian deities; attitudes towards witchcraft, superstition and the early monotheists; and evidence for ancient atheism. An epilogue discusses the rise of Christianity in the third and fourth centuries.Juliette Harrisson is Lecturer in History at Newman University, Birmingham. She is the author of Dreams and Dreaming in the Roman Empire: Cultural Memory and Imagination (2013).Eternal ChaliceThe Enduring Legend of the Holy GrailJuliette WoodThe sacred allure of the Holy Grail has fascinated writers and ensnared knights for over a thousand years. From Malory to Monty Python, the eternal chalice—said to be the very cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper—has the richest associations of any icon in British myth. Many different meanings have been devised for the Grail, which has been linked to the Celts and King Arthur, the eucharistic rites of Eastern Christianity, ancient mystery religions, Jungian archetypes, dualist heresies, Templar treasure and even the alleged descendants of Christ himself and Mary Magdalene. The common thread running through all these stories is the assumption that the Grail legend has a single source with a meaning that—if only we could decode it—is concealed in the romances themselves. That meaning has become the subject of coded, secret documents and is the central feature of a vast conspiracy supposedly stretching back to the dawn of western civilization. Juliette Wood here reveals the elusive and embedded significance of the Grail story in popular consciousness—as myth, medieval romance, tangible holy relic and finally as the centre of an esoteric theory of global conspiracy. The author shows how various interpretations of the Grail, over the centuries, reflect changing cultural needs and desires. Her book will enthral those who, like Sir Perceval, seek to unlock the mysterious secrets of western mythology's most extraordinary and tantalising enigma, and will delight students of history, myth and religion alike.Juliette Wood is one of Britain's leading experts on myth and folklore. Secretary of the Folklore Society, London, she is also an Associate Lecturer in the Department of Welsh at the University of Wales, Cardiff. A regular contributor to TV and radio, she is the author of several books on Celtic myth and legend, such as 'The Celts: Life, Myth and Legend' (Duncan Baird 2003) and 'The Rose and the Thistle: Essays on the Culture of Late Medieval and Renaissance Scotland (Tuckwell Press).A Short History of The MongolsGeorge LaneThe Mongol Empire was the mightiest land empire the world has ever seen. At its height it was twice the size of its Roman equivalent. For a remarkable century and a half it commanded a population of 100 million people, while the rule of Chinggis (Genghis) Khan marched undefeated from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea. George Lane argues that the Mongols were not only subjugators who swept all before them but one of the great organising forces of world history. His book traces the rise of the Great Khan in 1206 to the dissolution of the empire in 1368 by the Ming Dynasty. He discusses the unification of the Turko-Mongol tribes under Chinggis' leadership; the establishment of a vigorous imperium whose Pax Mongolica held mastery over the Central Asian steppes; imaginative policies of religious pluralism; and the rich legacy of the Toluid Empire of Yuan China and Ilkhanate Iran. Offering a bold and sympathetic understanding of Mongol history, the author shows that commercial expansion, cultural assimilation and dynamic political growth were as crucial to Mongol success as desire for conquest.George Lane is Senior Teaching Fellow in the History of the Middle East and Central Asia at SOAS in the University of London. His previous books are Early Mongol Rule in Thirteenth-Century Iran, Genghiz Khan and Mongol Rule, Daily Life in the Mongol Empire and Silk Roads and Steppe Empires.A Short History of the Crimean WarTrudi Tate<DIV>The Crimean War (1853–1856) was the first modern war. A vicious struggle between imperial Russia and an alliance of the British, French and Ottoman Empires, it was the first conflict to be reported first-hand in newspapers, painted by official war artists, recorded by telegraph and photographed by camera. In her new short history Trudi Tate discusses the ways in which this novel representation itself became part of the modern 'war machine'. She tells forgotten stories about the war experience of individual soldiers and civilians, including journalists, nurses, doctors, war tourists and other witnesses. At the same time, the war was a retrograde one, fought with the mentality, and some of the equipment, of Napoleonic times. Tate argues that the Crimean War was both modern and old-fashioned, looking backwards and forwards, and generating optimism and despair among those who lived through it. She explores this paradox while giving full coverage to the bloody battles (Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman), the siege of Sebastopol, the much-derided strategies of the commanders, conditions in the field and the political impact of the anti-Russian alliance. In its skilful interweaving of military, medical and social history, the book offers a fresh and intriguing look at one of the most fascinating conflicts of modern times.</p></div><DIV>Trudi Tate is an Affliated Lecturer in English in the University of Cambridge, UK, and a Fellow of Clare Hall.

ParishWhen, in October 1517, Martin Luther pinned his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg he shattered the foundations of western Christendom. The Reformation of doctrine and practice that followed Luther’s seismic action, and protest against the sale of indulgences, fragmented the Church and overturned previously accepted certainties and priorities. But it did more, challenging the relationship between spiritual and secular authority, perceptions of the supernatural, the interpretation of the past, the role of women in society and church, and clerical attitudes towards marriage and sex. Drawing on the most recent historiography, Helen L Parish locates the Protestant Reformation in its many cultural, social and political contexts. She assesses the Reformers’ impact on art and architecture; on notions of authority, scripture and tradition; and—reflecting on the extent to which the printing press helped spread Reformation ideas—on oral, print and written culture.Helen L Parish is Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Reading. Her previous books include Monks, Miracles and Magic: Reformation Representations of the Medieval Church (2005) and Clerical Marriage and the English Reformation: Precedent, Policy and Practice (2000).A Short History of the NormansLeonie V. Hicks<div>The Battle of Hastings in 1066 is the one date forever seared on the British national psyche. It enabled the Norman Conquest that marked the end of Anglo-Saxon England. But there was much more to the Normans than the invading army Duke William shipped over from Normandy to the shores of Sussex. How a band of marauding warriors established some of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe – in Sicily and France, as well as England – is an improbably romantic idea. In exploring Norman culture in all its regions, Leonie V Hicks places the Normans in the context of early medieval society. Her comparative perspective enables the Norman story to be told in full, so that the societies of Rollo, William, Robert and Roger Guiscard are given the focused attention they deserve. From Hastings to the martial exploits of Bohemond and Tancred on the First Crusade; from castles and keeps to Romanesque cathedrals; and from the founding of the Kingdom of Sicily (1130) to cross-cultural encounters with Byzantines and Muslims, this is a fresh and lively survey of one of the most popular topics in European history. - – — ™ <p></p></div><div>Leonie V Hicks is Teaching Fellow in Medieval History at the University of Southampton, UK.

Morgan<DIV>From 1501, when the first slaves arrived in Hispaniola, until the nineteenth century, some twelve million people were abducted from west Africa and shipped across thousands of miles of ocean – the infamous Middle Passage – to work in the colonies of the New World. Perhaps two million Africans died at sea. Why was slavery so widely condoned, during most of this period, by leading lawyers, religious leaders, politicians and philosophers? How was it that the educated classes of the western world were prepared for so long to accept and promote an institution that would later ages be condemned as barbaric? Exploring these and other questions – and the slave experience on the sugar, rice, coffee and cotton plantations – Kenneth Morgan discusses the rise of a distinctively Creole culture; slave revolts, including the successful revolution in Haiti (1791-1804); and the rise of abolitionism, when the ideas of Montesquieu, Wilberforce, Quakers and others led to the slave trade's systemic demise. At a time when the menace of human trafficking is of increasing concern worldwide, this timely book reflects on the deeper motivations of slavery as both ideology and merchant institution.</p></div><DIV>Kenneth Morgan is Professor of History at Brunel University, UK.

In her elegant new introduction, Virginia Cox offers a fresh vision of this iconic moment in European cultural history, when – between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries – Italy led the world in painting, building, science and literature. Her book explores key artistic, literary and intellectual developments, but also histories of food and fashion, map-making, exploration and anatomy. Alongside towering figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Petrarch, Machiavelli and Isabella d'Este, Cox reveals a cast of lesser-known Renaissance protagonists including printers, travel writers, actresses, courtesans, explorers, inventors and even celebrity chefs. At the same time, Italy's rich regional diversity is emphasized; in addition to the great artistic capitals of Florence, Rome and Venice, smaller but cutting-edge centres such as Ferrara, Mantua, Bologna, Urbino and Siena are given their due. Each court and city, Cox argues, pursued its own distinctive version of the Italian Renaissance, animated by a lively civic rivalry that pushed cultural innovation to ever-new heights of ambition and achievement. Fired by this emulative urge, the great ruling dynasties of the age, from the Medici and the Sforza to the Este and Gonzaga, poured their vast wealth into architecture, art, spectacle and patronage of learning, leading to results that continue to inspire us. As the author demonstrates, women played a far more prominent role in this exhilarating resurgence than was recognized until very recently – both as patrons of art and literature and as creative artists themselves. 'Renaissance woman', she boldly argues, is as important a legacy as 'Renaissance man'.Virginia Cox is Professor of Italian at New York University.

FisherThe Mughal Empire dominated India politically, culturally, socially, economically and environmentally, from its foundation by Babur, a Central Asian adventurer, in 1526 to the final trial and exile of the last emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar at the hands of the British in 1858. Throughout the empire's three centuries of rise, preeminence and decline, it remained a dynamic and complex entity within and against which diverse peoples and interests conflicted. The empire's significance continues to be controversial among scholars and politicians with fresh and exciting new insights, theories and interpretations being put forward in recent years. This book engages students and general readers with a clear, lively and informed narrative of the core political events, the struggles and interactions of key individuals, groups and cultures, and of the contending historiographical arguments surrounding the Mughal Empire.Michael Fisher holds the Robert S. Danforth Chair in History. In 2007, he was awarded the Teaching Excellence Award for the Social Sciences. He has published widely on various aspects of the interaction between the peoples and polities of India and the expanding British empire, as they occurred in both India and in Britain.A Short History of English Renaissance DramaHelen Hackett<DIV><P>Shakespeare is a towering presence in English and indeed global culture. Most readers in the English-speaking world, and many beyond, know his name and have at least a passing familiarity with his work. Yet considered alongside his contemporaries he was not an isolated phenomenon, but the product of a period of astonishing creative fertility. This was an age when new media – popular drama, and print – were seized upon avidly and inventively by a generation of exceptionally talented writers. In her sparkling new book, Helen Hackett explores the historical contexts of English Renaissance drama by situating it in the wider history of ideas. She traces the origins of Renaissance theatre in communal religious drama, civil pageantry and court entertainment and vividly describes the playing conditions of Elizabethan and Jacobean playhouses. Examining Shakespeare, Marlowe and Jonson in turn, the author assesses the distinctive contribution made by each playwright to the creation of English drama. She then turns to revenge tragedy, with its gothic poetry of sex and death; city comedy, domestic tragedy and tragicomedy; and gender and drama, with female roles played by boy actors. The book places Renaissance drama in the exciting and vibrant cosmopolitanism of sixteenth-century London.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Helen Hackett is Professor of English at University College London.

His wild adventures live on in the books that have captivated millions of readers and inspired generations of writers. </DIV>Elizabeth and EssexA Tragic HistoryLytton  StracheyOne of the most famous and tortured romances in history—between Elizabeth I, Queen of England, and Robert Devereux, Earl of Essex—began in 1587, when she was fifty-three and he was nineteen. Their passionate affair continued for five years, until Essex was beheaded for treason in 1601. In a fast-paced succession of brilliantly-rendered scenes, Lytton Strachey portrays Elizabeth and Essex's compelling attraction for each other, their impassioned disagreements and their mutual struggle for power, which culminated so tragically—for both of them. Alongside the doomed love affair, Strachey pins colourful portraits of the leading characters and influential figures of the time: Francis Bacon, Walter Raleigh, Robert Cecil and other members of her glittering court who fought to assert themselves in a kingdom and a country defined by Elizabeth's incomparable reign. Lytton Strachey here illuminates, in spellbinding prose, one of the most poignant affairs in history alongside the glamour and intrigue of the Elizabethan era.Lytton Strachey (1880-1932), one of the most famous writers of his time, was a prominent member of the Bloomsbury Set and pioneer of a new style of biography. Author of, among others, 'Landmarks', 'Eminent Victorians' and 'Queen Victoria' (also Tauris Parke Paperbacks).HoraceA LifePeter Levi<DIV><DIV>The work of the great Roman poet, Horatius Flaccus (65 BC to 8 BC), spanned all aspects of Roman life—politics, the arts, religion, and the authority of the emperor—while his legendary poems ( <I>Satires, Odes, Epistles </I>) about friendship, philosophy, love, and sex still have considerable appeal. This biography presents a complete picture of Horace's life and world. It considers the details of Horace's romantic liaisons and why he never married, what the status of his father—a freedman—meant to the poet, and his distinctive brand of philosophy. In this acclaimed biography, Peter Levi, a fellow poet, has produced a thrilling and eminently readable book, the definitive account of Rome's greatest poet and the times during which he lived.</DIV></DIV><DIV></DIV><P>Peter Levi, FSA, FRSL, (1931-2000) was a poet, archaeologist, Jesuit priest, travel writer, scholar, biographer, and critic. Professor of Poetry at Oxford from 1984-89, Levi also worked for The Times (London),traveled with Bruce Chatwin in Afghanistan, with Leigh Fermor in Greece, and wrote over 60 highly acclaimed biographies and works of travel, including <I>The Light Garden of the Angel King</I>.Rome on the EuphratesThe Story of a FrontierFreya Stark<DIV><DIV>When Roman legions marched into Asia Minor in 200BC, their plan was to secure a buffer zone between the Mediterranean, which they virtually owned, and the area beyond, which they sought to isolate rather than control. Along the long frontier of the Euphrates in Turkey lay the easternmost limits of the Roman Empire—a region they called Augusta Euphrantentis. Their expanding involvement lasted eight centuries, draining their energies and culminating in the destruction of the bridge that, since the time of Alexander the Great, had linked China to the commerce of the Mediterranean. Tracing the path of this ancient river and highlighting her travels with the vibrant history of 800 years of Roman warfare and the history of this mighty river, Freya Stark ultimately reveals the futility of war, of arbitrary boundaries, and territorial conquest. Rome on the Euphrates, at once travel and history, is one of her most magnificent and highly acclaimed works.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Freya Stark (1893-1993), *the poet of travel,* was the doyenne of Middle East travel writers and one of the most courageous and adventurous female travelers in history. She traveled extensively through Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, and Southern Arabia, where she became the first western woman to travel through the Hadhramaut. Usually solo, she ventured to places few Europeans had ever been. Her travels earned her the title of Dame and huge public acclaim and her many, now classic, books include <I>Travels in the Near East, A Winter in Arabia, The Southern Gates of Arabia, Alexander's Path, Dust in the Lion's Paw, East is West, </I>and <I>Valleys of the Assassins, Baghdad Sketches</I>. </DIV>The Divine SupermarketTravels in Search of the Soul of AmericaMalise Ruthven<DIV><DIV>Traveling in a battered camping van, Malise Ruthven set out across America in search of the manifestations—often bizarre and sometimes terrifying—of its religious spirit. The journey took him from the dark woods of Puritan New England to neo-Nazi cults in the Rockies; from Mormons and snake handlers to fundamentalist groups who challenge the teaching of evolution; from channelers in California to the sexual and financial scandals surrounding millionaire TV preachers. <I>The Divine Supermarket </I>is his quirky and brilliantly-observed account of the journey, offering illuminating and humorous insights into the baffling soul of modern America.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Malise Ruthven is a writer and historian of the Islamic world, with a focus on religious fundamentalism. He has been a scriptwriter with the BBC Arabic and World Services, and has taught Islamic Studies and Comparative Religion at the University of Aberdeen, the University of California, and at Dartmouth. He is a frequent contributor to <I>The New York Review of Books</I>, among other publications, and is the author of several other books, including <I>Fury for God and Fundamentalism</I>. </DIV>Bayonets to LhasaFrancis Younghusband and The British Invasion of TibetPeter Fleming<DIV><DIV>The British invasion of Tibet in 1904 is one of the strangest events in British imperial history. Planned by Lord Curzon as a strategic move in the Great Game, the incursion was in fact ill-conceived and inspired by only the weakest of motivations. Led by the soldier, explorer, and mystic Francis Younghusband, the mission—doomed from the very beginning—became caught in political cross-fire and the distant and destructive machinations of China and England and ended in ignominy and disappointment. Peter Fleming's Bayonets to Lhasa is a gripping depiction of this unusual chain of events, its charismatic protagonists, and the repercussions that continue to be felt throughout the region.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Peter Fleming (1907–1971), was a journalist and writer and one of the last great adventurers of the twentieth century. He began his career as a special correspondent with <I>The Times (London), </I>and later wrote for <I>The Spectator</I>. He served with the Grenadier Guards during World War II and from 1942 was in charge of military deception operations in Southeast Asia. He is author of several classic books, including <I>Brazilian Adventure</I>, <I>To Peking</I>, <I>One's Company</I>, and <I>News from Tartary</I>. In his memory, The Royal Geographical Society established The Peter Fleming Award for projects that seek to advance geographical science.</DIV>South From EphesusTravels Through Aegean TurkeyBrian Sewell<DIV><DIV>Weary of what he called the “tyranny” of western art, Brian Sewell first visited Turkey—a country that had captivated him since he was a boy—in 1975. He thought that there, anything he found would have no relevance to the European art that he had so compulsively “stitched in to the dense fabric of my art-historical memory” and that he could therefore enjoy the art for its own sake. But Turkey surprised him, and he delighted in the unexpected wealth of Greek, Roman, Byzantine, and Islamic cultures there, returning three of four times a year until 1990. The bulk of this book focuses on his journey from Ephesus to Side one winter. With typically acerbic commentary, Sewell describes (not always favorably) the archaeological and historical sites he comes across, the landscapes that so clearly thrill him, the encounters he has along the way, and the fractious, though wonderfully funny, relationship he forms with Ayhan, his driver. This is a book that could only have been written by Sewell and has become a quirky classic of travel literature.</DIV></DIV><DIV><B>Brian Sewell</B> is one of the most recognizable names in art criticism today: discerning, often controversial, and--without fail--entertaining and informative. He appears regularly on TV and radio and is the art critic of the <I>Evening Standard</I>.<BR></DIV>Queen VictoriaA LifeLytton Strachey<DIV><DIV>Lytton Strachey's acclaimed portrayal of Queen Victoria revolutionized the art of biography by using elements of romantic fiction and melodrama to create a warm, humorous, and very human portrait of this iconic figure. We see Victoria as a strong-willed child with a famous temper, as the 18-year-old girl queen, as a monarch, wife, mother, and widow. Equally fascinating are the depictions of her relationships: with her governess “precious Lehzen,” with Peel, Gladstone, and Disraeli, with her beloved Albert, and, in later life, her legendary devotion to her Highland servant John Brown, all of which show a different side of the staid, pious image that is so often attached to her.</DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV>Lytton Strachey (1880–1932), one of the most famous writers of his time, was a prominent member of the Bloomsbury set and pioneer of a new style of biography. He is the author of, among others <I>Landmarks</I>, <I>Eminent Victorians,</I> and <I>Elizabeth and Essex.</I></DIV></DIV>VirgilA LifePeter Levi<DIV><DIV>Born in 70 BC, in a small village near Mantua, Publius Vergilius Maro—Virgil—grew up to be hailed as the greatest Roman poet. And although his work has influenced Western literature for two millennia, little is known about the man himself. Who was the man who created the Aeneid—one of the most important poems in Western literature—and such universal phrases as “love conquers all” and “fortune favors the bold?” Peter Levi here reconstructs the poet's life, from a childhood largely shrouded in mystery to his work as a great literary genius and revolutionary poet, by examining archaeological and historical evidence from Augustan Rome, as well as through close readings of the poet's own work. “Virgil is an intensely personal poet, yet he is anonymous . . . My aim is not so ambitious as to try and restore his prestige single-handed. It has simply been to try to understand him in his original context.” In this highly acclaimed, nowclassic biography, Peter Levi discards the myths and brilliantly reveals the life of Virgil and the extraordinary times during which he lived.</DIV></DIV><DIV>Peter Levi, FSA, FRSL, (1931—2000) was a poet, archaeologist, Jesuit priest, travel writer, scholar, biographer, and critic.

Chancellor of the Exchequer and a powerful and popular orator, leadership of the Conservative Party seemed within his grasp. A year later, however, all had changed. The Conservatives were defeated, and when a National Government was formed in 1931, Churchill was not asked to join it. Though he was a lone figure from this point, his acute political sense, foresight, and courage were undiminished. Fed with secret inside information by a group of brave men, Churchill consistently warned of the Nazi danger, even before the rise of Hitler. The government fought him at every turn, even refusing him the right to broadcast. But he never gave up. It was as a direct result of his brave perseverance that the British public came to realize the truth of his warnings—a bond formed that would be so vital in the years to come.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Sir Martin Gilbert</B> is Winston Churchill's official biographer and a leading historian of the modern world.

His mother had died a few months earlier and a single obsession had risen from his grief: the notion to build a feather-light flying machine. And so, on the island where Daedalus and Icarus had made man’s maiden flight, MacLean journeyed back to beginnings, back into the Greek myths, and—with the help of his Cretan neighbors and plenty of wine—built a plane and tried to fly.</P><P></P><P>Falling for Icarus is at once a meditation on love, a celebration of the passion for flight, and a hilarious, vivid portrait of a village. Its generous and exhilarating characters restore MacLean’s faith in life. Through them, he tells a soaring, moving story about how a dream can transform sadness.</P></DIV><BR></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Rory MacLean</B> is a writer, broadcaster, blogger, and fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. His eight books, including UK bestsellers <I>Stalin's Nose</I> and <I>Under the Dragon</I>, have challenged and invigorated travel writing and, according to the late John Fowles, are among works that “marvellously explain why literature still lives.” He has won awards from the Canada Council and the Arts Council of England as well as a Winston Churchill Travelling Fellowship, and was nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary prize. He has written and presented over 50 BBC radio programs and worked on movies with Marlene Dietrich and David Bowie.

One of the main architects of the Nazi regime, he was also instrumental in the creation of the Gestapo and directly ordered the Final Solution. But who was the man behind the carefully constructed mask? </P><P>Self-indulgent and ruthless, sybaritic and brutal, egotistical yet capable of self-effacement, weak-willed yet fiercely calculating, Goering was a contradictory, complex, and often buffoonish character. In this classic biography, Richard Overy takes the reader on a chilling journey into the heart of Hitler’s inner circle. He illuminates the many facets of Goering’s personality and charts his story from his golden days as Hitler’s most trusted commander to his failures and loss of power after the Battle of Britain, his sensational trial at Nuremberg, and his ignominious death by suicide on the eve of his execution.  </P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Richard Overy's</B> award-winning writing on the history of World War II and the Third Reich has been praised as *highly effective in the ruthless dispelling of myths* (A.

G. H. James<DIV>In November 1922, a momentous discovery - unlike any other before or since - was to change our understanding of the ancient world. Until now, however, the marvelous story of Carter's quest for Tutankhamun and its culmination in his unearthing of the intact, treasure-filled tomb has been told without a reliable account of the man behind the discovery and the myths that have surrounded it. Howard Carter's career was a remarkable one: he had arrived in Egypt 30 years earlier as a 17-year old ""tracer"" with rudimentary education, and progressed to become the first Chief Inspector of Antiquities in Upper Egypt. An improbable but auspicious partnership with the 5th Earl of Carnarvon developed in which the young Carter acted as assistant and ""learned man"" to the aristocrat's excavations in the Theban necropolis. But it was the legendary discovery in the Valley of the Kings and Carter's painstaking clearance of the intact royal burial that was to secure his place in history. He became an international celebrity, simultaneously honored and vilified wherever he went, but he was also a sad, disillusioned man whose success never brought any reward of happiness. T.G.H. James' definitive biography is both the story of perhaps the most renowned archaeologist of all time and of an essentially tragic human being.</DIV><DIV>T.G.H.

For Halliburton, it was the ultimate in romantic, risky exploration and was a means of seeing the world in a way that few had ever seen it before. True to form, his journey was breathtakingly audacious. They performed aerobatics in Fez; landed in mysterious Timbuktu; spent time with the French Foreign Legion in Algeria; and explored Cairo, Damascus, and Petra. In India, they flew over the Taj Mahal—upside down—and, soaring over the Himalayas, Halliburton took the first aerial photograph of Everest. A journey as dazzling as Halliburton himself and, with the world at war less than a decade later, marking the end of an era, the story of The Flying Carpet is as captivating today as it was to the world 80 years ago.</P></DIV></DIV><DIV><DIV><B>Richard Halliburton</B> (1900-1939) was America's greatest adventurer and one of the most successful adventure travel writers of the 20th century.

A detachment of German soldiers arrive in a rural French town, hunting down resistance fighters, many of whom are hiding in the region. More than sixty years later, the villagers clearly remember the day when four peasants from a nearby village were taken hostage and shot as an example to others. But do they remember the whole story? Jean-Marie Borzeix sets out to investigate the events of Holy Thursday 1944, and to reveal the hidden truths of that fateful day. He uncovers the story of a mysterious 'fifth man' shot alongside the resisters and eventually unravels a trail which leads him to Paris, Israel and into the darkest corners of the Holocaust in France. A captivating story, the events of this day in a small, entirely typical, town illuminate the true impact of World War II in France.Jean-Marie Borzeix is a journalist, writer and broadcaster. He began his career as a reporter writing for Combat and the Quotidien de Paris before becoming editor-in-chief of Nouvelles Littéraires and literary editor for Editions du Seuil.

Yet some organisations are succeeding. Why are organisations such as Vice and BuzzFeed investing in journalism and why are pedigree journalists joining them? Why are news organisations making journalists redundant but recruiting technologists? Why does everyone seem to be embracing native advertising? Why are some news organisations more innovative than others? Drawing on extensive first-hand research this book explains how different international media organisations approach digital news and pinpoints the common organisational factors that help build their success.Lucy Küng is a Research Fellow at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, University of Oxford.

The two professions have vied with each other for primacy: journalists could open or close the gates, but PR had the stories, the contacts and often the budgets for extravagant campaigns. The arrival of the internet, and especially of social media, has changed much of that. These new technologies have turned the audience into players – who play an important part in making the reputation, and the brand, of everyone from heads of state to new car models vulnerable to viral tweets and social media attacks. Companies, parties and governments are seeking more protection – especially since individuals within these organisations can themselves damage, even destroy, their brand or reputation with an ill-chosen remark or an appearance of arrogance. The pressures, and the possibilities, of the digital age have given public figures and institutions both a necessity to protect themselves, and channels to promote themselves free of news media gatekeepers. Political and corporate communications professionals have become more essential, and more influential within the top echelons of business, politics and other institutions. Companies and governments can now – must now – become media themselves, putting out a message 24/7, establishing channels of their own, creating content to attract audiences and reaching out to their networks to involve them in their strategies Journalism is being brought into these new, more influential and fast growing communications strategies. And, as newspapers struggle to stay alive, journalists must adapt to a world where old barriers are being smashed and new relationships built – this time with public relations in the driving seat. The world being created is at once more protected and more transparent; the communicators are at once more influential and more fragile. This unique study illuminates a new media age.<div>John Lloyd is the Director of Journalism at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism as well as a contributing editor at the Financial Time s, a columnist for Reuters.com and for La Repubblica of Rome.<br><br>Laura Toogood was awarded her PhD in Social Informatics from University College Dublin in 2010.

Although there have been considerable changes in the prospects for women working in the media in the past few decades, women are still noticeably in the minority in the top journalistic roles, despite making up the majority of journalism students. In this book, Suzanne Franks looks at the key issues surrounding female journalists – from on-screen sexism and ageism to the dangers facing female foreign correspondents reporting from war zones. She also analyses the way that the changing digital media have presented both challenges and opportunities for women working in journalism and considers this in an international perspective. In doing so, this book provides an overview of the ongoing imbalances faced by women in the media and looks at the key issues hindering gender equality in journalism.</DIV><DIV>Suzanne Franks is Professor of Journalism at City University London.

Some researchers have argued that stressing the 'risks' posed by climate change rather than the 'uncertainties' can create a more helpful context for policy makers and a stronger response from the public. However, understanding the concepts of risk and uncertainty – and how to communicate them – is a hotly debated issue. In this book, James Painter analyses how the international media present these and other narratives surrounding climate change. He focuses on the coverage of reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and of the melting ice of the Arctic Sea, and includes six countries: Australia, France, India, Norway, the UK and the USA.</DIV><DIV>James Painter is Head of the Journalism Fellowship Programme at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, Oxford University, UK.

PicardThe vulnerability of journalists to kidnappings was starkly illustrated by the killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff by Islamic militants in 2014. Their murder underscored the risks taken by journalists and news organisations trying to cover developments in dangerous regions of the world and has forced news enterprises to more clearly prepare for and confront issues of safety. This book explores the complex organisational issues surrounding the capture or kidnapping of journalists in areas of conflict and risk. It explores how journalists 'becoming news' is covered and the implications of that coverage, how news organisations prepare for and respond to such events, and how kidnapping and ransom insurers, victim recovery firms, journalists' families, and governments influence the actions of news enterprises. It considers how and why journalists are kidnapped, how employers and journalists' organisations respond to kidnappings and why freelancers are particularly at risk as well as suggesting best practices for preventing and responding to kidnappings.Robert G.

They invoked the local gods to rain down punishment on adulterers or thieves. They burned fragrant resin for the protecting deities of hearth and home. They sacrificed at temples to bring glory to the divine person of the emperor. And they conducted secret rites of initiation into cults like those devoted to Isis, Cybele, Dionysus and Mithras. Juliette Harrisson shows ancient Rome to have been a hive of religious experimentation. In her new and comprehensive survey, she takes her readers from the turmoil of the Late Republic to the high point of imperial rule (133 BC-AD 235), thereby exploring the many facets of religiosity in the Roman world. She examines, among other topics, worship of the state-sanctioned Olympian gods and the role of religion in Roman politics; the impact of 'mystery cults' focused on Greek, Near Eastern and Egyptian deities; attitudes towards witchcraft, superstition and the early monotheists; and evidence for ancient atheism. An epilogue discusses the rise of Christianity in the third and fourth centuries.Juliette Harrisson is Lecturer in History at Newman University, Birmingham. She is the author of Dreams and Dreaming in the Roman Empire: Cultural Memory and Imagination (2013).Eternal ChaliceThe Enduring Legend of the Holy GrailJuliette WoodThe sacred allure of the Holy Grail has fascinated writers and ensnared knights for over a thousand years. From Malory to Monty Python, the eternal chalice—said to be the very cup from which Christ drank at the Last Supper—has the richest associations of any icon in British myth. Many different meanings have been devised for the Grail, which has been linked to the Celts and King Arthur, the eucharistic rites of Eastern Christianity, ancient mystery religions, Jungian archetypes, dualist heresies, Templar treasure and even the alleged descendants of Christ himself and Mary Magdalene. The common thread running through all these stories is the assumption that the Grail legend has a single source with a meaning that—if only we could decode it—is concealed in the romances themselves. That meaning has become the subject of coded, secret documents and is the central feature of a vast conspiracy supposedly stretching back to the dawn of western civilization. Juliette Wood here reveals the elusive and embedded significance of the Grail story in popular consciousness—as myth, medieval romance, tangible holy relic and finally as the centre of an esoteric theory of global conspiracy. The author shows how various interpretations of the Grail, over the centuries, reflect changing cultural needs and desires. Her book will enthral those who, like Sir Perceval, seek to unlock the mysterious secrets of western mythology's most extraordinary and tantalising enigma, and will delight students of history, myth and religion alike.Juliette Wood is one of Britain's leading experts on myth and folklore. Secretary of the Folklore Society, London, she is also an Associate Lecturer in the Department of Welsh at the University of Wales, Cardiff. A regular contributor to TV and radio, she is the author of several books on Celtic myth and legend, such as 'The Celts: Life, Myth and Legend' (Duncan Baird 2003) and 'The Rose and the Thistle: Essays on the Culture of Late Medieval and Renaissance Scotland (Tuckwell Press).A Short History of The MongolsGeorge LaneThe Mongol Empire was the mightiest land empire the world has ever seen. At its height it was twice the size of its Roman equivalent. For a remarkable century and a half it commanded a population of 100 million people, while the rule of Chinggis (Genghis) Khan marched undefeated from the Pacific Ocean to the Caspian Sea. George Lane argues that the Mongols were not only subjugators who swept all before them but one of the great organising forces of world history. His book traces the rise of the Great Khan in 1206 to the dissolution of the empire in 1368 by the Ming Dynasty. He discusses the unification of the Turko-Mongol tribes under Chinggis' leadership; the establishment of a vigorous imperium whose Pax Mongolica held mastery over the Central Asian steppes; imaginative policies of religious pluralism; and the rich legacy of the Toluid Empire of Yuan China and Ilkhanate Iran. Offering a bold and sympathetic understanding of Mongol history, the author shows that commercial expansion, cultural assimilation and dynamic political growth were as crucial to Mongol success as desire for conquest.George Lane is Senior Teaching Fellow in the History of the Middle East and Central Asia at SOAS in the University of London. His previous books are Early Mongol Rule in Thirteenth-Century Iran, Genghiz Khan and Mongol Rule, Daily Life in the Mongol Empire and Silk Roads and Steppe Empires.A Short History of the Crimean WarTrudi Tate<DIV>The Crimean War (1853–1856) was the first modern war. A vicious struggle between imperial Russia and an alliance of the British, French and Ottoman Empires, it was the first conflict to be reported first-hand in newspapers, painted by official war artists, recorded by telegraph and photographed by camera. In her new short history Trudi Tate discusses the ways in which this novel representation itself became part of the modern 'war machine'. She tells forgotten stories about the war experience of individual soldiers and civilians, including journalists, nurses, doctors, war tourists and other witnesses. At the same time, the war was a retrograde one, fought with the mentality, and some of the equipment, of Napoleonic times. Tate argues that the Crimean War was both modern and old-fashioned, looking backwards and forwards, and generating optimism and despair among those who lived through it. She explores this paradox while giving full coverage to the bloody battles (Alma, Balaklava, Inkerman), the siege of Sebastopol, the much-derided strategies of the commanders, conditions in the field and the political impact of the anti-Russian alliance. In its skilful interweaving of military, medical and social history, the book offers a fresh and intriguing look at one of the most fascinating conflicts of modern times.</p></div><DIV>Trudi Tate is an Affliated Lecturer in English in the University of Cambridge, UK, and a Fellow of Clare Hall.

ParishWhen, in October 1517, Martin Luther pinned his Ninety-Five Theses to the door of All Saints’ Church in Wittenberg he shattered the foundations of western Christendom. The Reformation of doctrine and practice that followed Luther’s seismic action, and protest against the sale of indulgences, fragmented the Church and overturned previously accepted certainties and priorities. But it did more, challenging the relationship between spiritual and secular authority, perceptions of the supernatural, the interpretation of the past, the role of women in society and church, and clerical attitudes towards marriage and sex. Drawing on the most recent historiography, Helen L Parish locates the Protestant Reformation in its many cultural, social and political contexts. She assesses the Reformers’ impact on art and architecture; on notions of authority, scripture and tradition; and—reflecting on the extent to which the printing press helped spread Reformation ideas—on oral, print and written culture.Helen L Parish is Senior Lecturer in History at the University of Reading. Her previous books include Monks, Miracles and Magic: Reformation Representations of the Medieval Church (2005) and Clerical Marriage and the English Reformation: Precedent, Policy and Practice (2000).A Short History of the NormansLeonie V. Hicks<div>The Battle of Hastings in 1066 is the one date forever seared on the British national psyche. It enabled the Norman Conquest that marked the end of Anglo-Saxon England. But there was much more to the Normans than the invading army Duke William shipped over from Normandy to the shores of Sussex. How a band of marauding warriors established some of the most powerful kingdoms in Europe – in Sicily and France, as well as England – is an improbably romantic idea. In exploring Norman culture in all its regions, Leonie V Hicks places the Normans in the context of early medieval society. Her comparative perspective enables the Norman story to be told in full, so that the societies of Rollo, William, Robert and Roger Guiscard are given the focused attention they deserve. From Hastings to the martial exploits of Bohemond and Tancred on the First Crusade; from castles and keeps to Romanesque cathedrals; and from the founding of the Kingdom of Sicily (1130) to cross-cultural encounters with Byzantines and Muslims, this is a fresh and lively survey of one of the most popular topics in European history. - – — ™ <p></p></div><div>Leonie V Hicks is Teaching Fellow in Medieval History at the University of Southampton, UK.

Morgan<DIV>From 1501, when the first slaves arrived in Hispaniola, until the nineteenth century, some twelve million people were abducted from west Africa and shipped across thousands of miles of ocean – the infamous Middle Passage – to work in the colonies of the New World. Perhaps two million Africans died at sea. Why was slavery so widely condoned, during most of this period, by leading lawyers, religious leaders, politicians and philosophers? How was it that the educated classes of the western world were prepared for so long to accept and promote an institution that would later ages be condemned as barbaric? Exploring these and other questions – and the slave experience on the sugar, rice, coffee and cotton plantations – Kenneth Morgan discusses the rise of a distinctively Creole culture; slave revolts, including the successful revolution in Haiti (1791-1804); and the rise of abolitionism, when the ideas of Montesquieu, Wilberforce, Quakers and others led to the slave trade's systemic demise. At a time when the menace of human trafficking is of increasing concern worldwide, this timely book reflects on the deeper motivations of slavery as both ideology and merchant institution.</p></div><DIV>Kenneth Morgan is Professor of History at Brunel University, UK.

In her elegant new introduction, Virginia Cox offers a fresh vision of this iconic moment in European cultural history, when – between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries – Italy led the world in painting, building, science and literature. Her book explores key artistic, literary and intellectual developments, but also histories of food and fashion, map-making, exploration and anatomy. Alongside towering figures such as Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo, Raphael, Petrarch, Machiavelli and Isabella d'Este, Cox reveals a cast of lesser-known Renaissance protagonists including printers, travel writers, actresses, courtesans, explorers, inventors and even celebrity chefs. At the same time, Italy's rich regional diversity is emphasized; in addition to the great artistic capitals of Florence, Rome and Venice, smaller but cutting-edge centres such as Ferrara, Mantua, Bologna, Urbino and Siena are given their due. Each court and city, Cox argues, pursued its own distinctive version of the Italian Renaissance, animated by a lively civic rivalry that pushed cultural innovation to ever-new heights of ambition and achievement. Fired by this emulative urge, the great ruling dynasties of the age, from the Medici and the Sforza to the Este and Gonzaga, poured their vast wealth into architecture, art, spectacle and patronage of learning, leading to results that continue to inspire us. As the author demonstrates, women played a far more prominent role in this exhilarating resurgence than was recognized until very recently – both as patrons of art and literature and as creative artists themselves. 'Renaissance woman', she boldly argues, is as important a legacy as 'Renaissance man'.Virginia Cox is Professor of Italian at New York University.

FisherThe Mughal Empire dominated India politically, culturally, socially, economically and environmentally, from its foundation by Babur, a Central Asian adventurer, in 1526 to the final trial and exile of the last emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar at the hands of the British in 1858. Throughout the empire's three centuries of rise, preeminence and decline, it remained a dynamic and complex entity within and against which diverse peoples and interests conflicted. The empire's significance continues to be controversial among scholars and politicians with fresh and exciting new insights, theories and interpretations being put forward in recent years. This book engages students and general readers with a clear, lively and informed narrative of the core political events, the struggles and interactions of key individuals, groups and cultures, and of the contending historiographical arguments surrounding the Mughal Empire.Michael Fisher holds the Robert S. Danforth Chair in History. In 2007, he was awarded the Teaching Excellence Award for the Social Sciences. He has published widely on various aspects of the interaction between the peoples and polities of India and the expanding British empire, as they occurred in both India and in Britain.A Short History of English Renaissance DramaHelen Hackett<DIV><P>Shakespeare is a towering presence in English and indeed global culture. Most readers in the English-speaking world, and many beyond, know his name and have at least a passing familiarity with his work. Yet considered alongside his contemporaries he was not an isolated phenomenon, but the product of a period of astonishing creative fertility. This was an age when new media – popular drama, and print – were seized upon avidly and inventively by a generation of exceptionally talented writers. In her sparkling new book, Helen Hackett explores the historical contexts of English Renaissance drama by situating it in the wider history of ideas. She traces the origins of Renaissance theatre in communal religious drama, civil pageantry and court entertainment and vividly describes the playing conditions of Elizabethan and Jacobean playhouses. Examining Shakespeare, Marlowe and Jonson in turn, the author assesses the distinctive contribution made by each playwright to the creation of English drama. She then turns to revenge tragedy, with its gothic poetry of sex and death; city comedy, domestic tragedy and tragicomedy; and gender and drama, with female roles played by boy actors. The book places Renaissance drama in the exciting and vibrant cosmopolitanism of sixteenth-century London.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Helen Hackett is Professor of English at University College London.

For all its variety – gospels, letters and visions – this first-century collection of texts keeps always at its centre the enigmatic figure of Joshua/Jesus: the Jewish prophet who gathered a group around him, proclaimed the imminent end of the world, but was made captive by the authorities of Rome only to suffer a shameful criminal's death on a cross. When his followers (including former persecutor Saul/Paul) became convinced that Jesus had defeated extinction, and had risen again to fresh life, the movement crossed over from Palestine to ignite the entire Graeco-Roman Mediterranean world. The author shows how the writings of this vibrant new faith came into being from oral transmission and then became the pillar of a great world religion. He explores their many varied usages in music, liturgy, art, language and literature. In discussing its textual origins, as well as its later reception, Moxnes shows above all how the New Testament has been employed both as a tool for liberation and as a means of power and control.</p></div><DIV>Halvor Moxnes is Professor of New Testament Studies at the University of Oslo, Norway.

J. Rhodes<DIV>Classical Greece and its legacy have long inspired a powerful and passionate fascination. The civilization that bequeathed to later ages drama and democracy, Homer and heroism, myth and Mycenae and the Delphic Oracle and the Olympic Games has, perhaps more than any other, helped shape the intellectual contours of the modern world. P J Rhodes is among the most distinguished historians of antiquity. In this elegant, zesty new survey he explores the archaic (8th–early 5th centuries BCE), classical (5th and 4th centuries BCE) and Hellenistic (late 4th–mid-2nd centuries BCE) periods up to the beginning of Roman hegemony. His scope is that of the peoples who originated on the Greek mainland and Aegean islands who later migrated to the shores of the Mediterranean and Black Seas, and then (following the conquests of Alexander) to the Near East and beyond. Exploring topics such as the epic struggle with Persia; the bitter rivalry of Athens and Sparta; slaves and ethnicity; religion and philosophy; and literature and the visual arts, this authoritative book will attract students and non-specialists in equal measure.</p></div><DIV>P.

It ruled much of Europe and Asia Minor for a remarkable eleven hundred years. From Constantine's establishment of Byzantium (renamed Constantinople) as his capital in 324 CE, until the fall of the city to the Ottomans in the fifteenth century, the Byzantines became a powerhouse of literature, art, theology, medicine, law and learning. Dionysios Stathakopoulos here tells a compelling story of military conquest, alliance and reversal, including the terrifying secret weapon of 'Greek fire'. His new short history is above all a narrative of individuals: of powerful rulers like Justinian I, who recovered Italy from the Vandals and oversaw construction of Hagia Sofia (completed in 537); of his notorious queen Theodora, a courtesan who rose improbably to the highest office of imperial first lady; of the charismatic but cuckolded general Belisarius; and of the religious leaders Arius and Athanasius, whose conflicting ideas about Christ and doctrine shook the Empire to its core.<br/></p></div><DIV>Dionysios Stathakopoulos is Lecturer in Byzantine Studies at King's College London, UK.

Not only did it pit countryman against countryman, and neighbor against neighbor, but from 1936-39 this bitterly contended struggle sucked in competing and seemingly atavistic forces that were soon to rage across the face of Europe, and then the rest of the world: nationalism and republicanism; communism and fascism; anarchism and monarchism; anti-clerical reformism and aristocratic Catholic conservatism. The ""Guerra Civil"" is of enduring interest precisely because it represents much more than just a regional contest for power and governmental legitimacy. It has come to be seen as a seedbed for the titanic political struggles and larger social upheavals that scarred the entire twentieth century. In elegant and accessible prose, Julián Casanova tells the gripping story of these years of anguish and trauma, which hit the country with a force hitherto unknown at any time in Spain's history. Charting the most significant events and battles alongside the main players in the tragedy, he provides answers to some of the pressing questions (such as the roots and extent of anti-clerical violence) that have been asked in the seventy years that have passed since the painful defeat of the Second Republic.</P></DIV><DIV><P>Julián Casanova is Professor of History at the University of Zaragoza.

A bloody thirty-year struggle between the dynastic houses of Lancaster and York, they embraced localized vendetta (such as the bitter northern feud between the Percies and Nevilles) as well as the formal clash of royalist and rebel armies at St Albans, Ludford Bridge, Mortimer's Cross, Towton, Tewkesbury and finally Bosworth, when the usurping Yorkist king Richard was crushed by Henry Tudor. Powerful personalities dominate the period: the charismatic and enigmatic Richard III, immortalized by Shakespeare; the slippery Warwick, ""the kingmaker,"" who finally over-reached ambition to be cut down at the battle of Barnet; and guileful women like Elizabeth Woodville and Margaret of Anjou, who for a time ruled the kingdom in her husband's stead. David Grummitt places the violent events of this complex time in the wider context of fifteenth-century kingship and the development of English political culture. Never losing sight of the traumatic impact of war on the lives of those who either fought in or were touched by battle, this captivating new history will make compelling reading for students of the late medieval period and Tudor England, as well as for general readers.</P></DIV><DIV><P>David Grummitt is Lecturer in British History at the University of Kent.

Ideologically defined by the colonists' formal Declaration of Independence in 1776, the struggle has taken on something a mythic character, especially in the United States. From the Boston Tea Party to Paul Revere's ride to raise the countryside of New England against the march of the Redcoats; from the heroic resistance of the militia Minutemen at the battles of Lexington and Concord to the famous crossing of the Delaware by General George Washington; and from the American travails of Bunker Hill (1775) to the final humiliation of the British at Yorktown (1781), the entire contest is now emblematic of American national identity. Stephen Conway shows that, beyond mythology, this was more than just a local conflict: rather a titanic struggle between France and Britain. The thirteen colonies were merely one frontline of an extended theatre of operations, with each superpower aiming to deliver the knockout blow. This bold new history recognizes the war as the Revolution but situates it on the wider, global canvas of European warfare.</p></div><DIV>Stephen Conway is Professor of History at University College London.

The brief fourteen-year period of democracy between the Treaty of Versailles and the advent of the Third Reich was marked by unstable government, economic crisis and hyperinflation and the rise of extremist political movements. At the same time, however, a vibrant cultural scene flourished, which continues to influence the international art world through the aesthetics of Expressionism and the Bauhaus movement. In the fields of art, literature, theatre, cinema, music and architecture – not to mention science – Germany became a world leader during the 1920s, while her perilous political and economic position ensured that no US or European statesman could afford to ignore her. Incorporating original research and a synthesis of the existing historiography, this book will provide students and a general readership with a clear and concise introduction to the history of the first German Republic. </p></div><DIV>Colin Storer is Lecturer in History at the University of Nottingham, UK.

Books about atheism by writers like Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens have figured prominently in bestseller lists and have attracted widespread discussion in the media. The ubiquity of public debates about atheism, especially in conscious opposition to the perceived social threat posed by faith and religion, has been startling. However, as Gavin Hyman points out, despite their prevalence and popularity, what often characterizes these debates is a lack of nuance and sophistication. They can be shrill, ignorant of the historical complexity of debates about belief, and tend to lapse into caricature. What is needed is a clear and well informed presentation of how atheistic ideas originated and developed, in order to illuminate their contemporary relevance and application. That task is what the author undertakes here. Exploring the rise of atheism as an explicit philosophical position (notably in the work of Denis Diderot), Hyman traces its development in the later ideas of Descartes, Locke, and Berkeley. Drawing also on the work of contemporary scholars like Amos Funkenstein and Michael J Buckley, the author shows that, since in recent theology the concept of God which atheists negate is changing, the triumph of its advocates may not be quite as unequivocal as Hitchens and Dawkins would have us believe.<P>Gavin Hyman is Lecturer in Religious Studies at Lancaster University.

What is secularism? And how should we understand the the concept of 'secularism' in international relations, particularly the clash between radical Islam and the West? The word 'secular' has come to mean that which belongs to this life, to the here and now, in this world. It is widely used as a shorthand for the ideology which shapes contemporary society without reference to the divine. However, according to Graeme Smith, 'secularism' represents a great deal more. He offers a radical reappraisal of the notion of secularism and its history, beginning with the Greeks and proceeding to modernity and the contemporary period. The assumption that the West is becoming increasingly secular is often unquestioned. By contrast, Dr Smith discerns a different kind of society: one informed by a historical legacy which makes sense only when it is appreciated that it is religious. Secularism was born of Christianity. Daringly - and very originally - Smith argues that it is impossible to understand the idea of the secular without appreciating that, at root, it is Christian. <i>A Short History of Secularism</i> will fundamentally reshape discussions of western culture, religion and politics, and will have strong appeal to students of religion, political philosophy and the history of ideas.</div></div><div><div><b>Graeme Smith</b> is Dean of Non-Residential Training at St Michael's College, Llandaff and associate lecturer at the University of Cardiff.

ShepardsonTurkey Run became Indiana's second state park in 1916. Within its boundaries lie some of the more rugged and stunning landscapes to be found in Indiana. Its sandstone bluffs and canyons, created by centuries of melting glaciers and running water, are filled with unique landforms and beautiful landscapes supporting a wide array of plant and animal life. A Place Called Turkey Run captures the majesty and mystique of the park in text and hundreds of full-color images. The work is organized into six distinct photo essays on the park's beauty: sandstone; bluffs and canyons; flowing water; snow and ice; tall trees; and flowers, ferns, and fungi. This book is published to honor the natural heritage of the land it describes, in celebration of Turkey Run's hundredth anniversary as an Indiana State Park.Daniel P.

Including readings of English, German, Dutch, and Egyptian adaptations ranging from the early modern period to the contemporary moment, this collection emphasizes the interdisciplinary and transcultural tenets of comparative cultural studies. Authors variously analyze the Faustian theme in contexts such as subjectivity, genre, politics, and identity. Chapters focus on the work of Christopher Marlowe, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Adelbert von Chamisso, Lord Byron, Heinrich Heine, Thomas Mann, D. J. Enright, Konrad Boehmer, Mahmoud Aboudoma, Bridge Markland, Andreas Gössling, and Uschi Flacke. Contributors include Frederick Burwick, Christa Knellwolf King, Ehrhard Bahr, Konrad Boehmer, and David G. John. Faust Adaptations demonstrates the enduring meaningfulness of the Faust concept across borders, genres, languages, nations, cultures, and eras. This collection presents innovative approaches to understanding the mediated, translated, and adapted figure of Faust through both culturally specific inquiry and timeless questions.Lorna Fitzsimmons is a professor of humanities at California State University, Dominguez Hills. She is the editor of Goethe's Faust and Cultural Memory: Comparatist Interfaces (2012); International Faust Studies: Adaptation, Reception, Translation (2008); Lives of Faust: The Faust Theme in Literature and Music: A Reader (2008); and The Oxford Handbook of Faust in Music (co-edited with Charles McKnight, Zoltan Roman, and Jonathan Kregor, forthcoming).Where Do We Go From Here?Charleston Conference Proceedings, 2015Beth R.

GreenspoonDictionary definitions of the term mishpachah are seemingly straightforward: "A Jewish family or social unit including close and distant relatives—sometimes also close friends." As accurate as such definitions are, they fail to capture the diversity and vitality of real, flesh-and-blood Jewish families. Families have been part of Jewish life for as long as there have been Jews. It is useful to recall that the family is the basic narrative building block of the stories in the biblical book of Genesis, which can be interpreted in the light of ancient literary traditions, archaeological discoveries, and rabbinic exegesis. Rabbinic literature also is filled with discussions about interactions, rancorous as well as amicable, between parents and among siblings. Sometimes harmony characterizes relations between the parent and the child; as often, alas, there is conflict. The rabbis, always aware of the realities of life, chide and advise as best they can. For the modern period, the changing roles of males and females in society at large have contributed to differing expectations as to their roles within the family. The relative increase in the number of adopted children, from both Jewish and non-Jewish backgrounds, and more recently, the shifting reality of assisted reproductive technologies and the possibility of cloning human embryos, all raise significant moral and theological questions that require serious consideration. Through the studies brought together in this volume, more than a dozen scholars look at the Jewish family in wide variety of social, historical, religious, and geographical contexts. In the process, they explore both diverse and common features in the past and present, and they chart possible courses for Jewish families in the future.Leonard J. Greenspoon holds the Klutznick Chair in Jewish Civilization at Creighton University, where he also is a professor of Classical and Near Eastern Studies and of theology.

Individually, each became a legendary dean of women or dean of students. Collectively, they wove a sisterhood of mutual support in their common—sometimes thwarted—pursuit of shared human rights and equality. Dorothy C. Stratton, Helen B. Schleman, M. Beverley Stone, Barbara I. Cook, and Betty M. Nelson opened new avenues for women and became conduits for change, fostering opportunities for all people. They were loved by students and revered by colleagues. The women also were respected throughout the United States as founding leaders of the Coast Guard Women's Reserve (SPARs), frontrunners in the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors, and as pivotal members of presidential committees in the Kennedy and Nixon administrations. While it is focused on changing attitudes on one college campus, The Deans' Bible sheds light on cultural change in America as a whole, exploring how each of the deans participated nationally in the quest for equality. The story rolls through the "picture-perfect," suppressive 1950s, the awakening 1960s, women's liberation, Title IX, 1980s AIDS and alcohol epidemics, the changing mores for the disabled, and ends in the twenty-first century. As each woman succeeded the other, forming a five-dean friendship, they knitted their bond with a secret symbol—a Bible. Originally possessed by Purdue's first part-time Dean of Women Carolyn Shoemaker, the Bible was handed down from dean to dean with favorite passages marked. The lowercased word "bible" is often used in connection with reference works or "guidebooks." The Deans' Bible serves as a guidebook, brimming with stories of courageous women who led by example and lived their convictions.Angie Klink writes biographies, histories, children's books, essays, and advertising copy.

In response, Budapest's Jewish community leaders organized an Artistic Enterprise under the aegis of OMIKE Országos Magyar Izraelita Közművelődési Egyesület (Hungarian Jewish Education Association) to provide employment and livelihood for actors, singers, musicians, conductors, composers, writers, playwrights, painters, graphic artists, and sculptors. Between 1939 and 1944, activities were centered in Goldmark Hall beside the Dohány Street Synagogue in Budapest. Hundreds of artists from all over Hungary took part in about one thousand performances, including plays, concerts, cabaret, ballet, operas, and operettas. These performances appealed to the highly cultured Budapest Jewish community, ever desirous of high-caliber events, particularly under oppressive conditions of the time. Art exhibitions also were held for painters, graphic artists, and sculptors to sell their creations. Lévai's 1943 book (with new, additional chapters by noted historians and musicians) is the core of this expanded edition and provides interviews with individual artists who recall their early lives and circumstances that led them to join the Artistic Enterprise. The book records the technical functioning, structure, and operation of this remarkable theater and concert venue. It provides fascinating details about those who worked behind the scenes: répétiteurs, hair stylists, and personnel involved with costumes, lighting, and scenery. Because the stage was small, clever choreographic and scenery improvisation had to be made, and the stagehands were clearly up to the task. Since these artists were not allowed to perform before the general public or advertise with posters on the streets, the book describes special means devised to overcome these difficulties and bring Jewish audiences into the theater in large numbers. Lastly, the book carries the theater's story up to Sunday morning, March 19, 1944, a day of infamy, when the German army marched into Hungary.Frederick Bondy lives in New York City and was married for over forty years until losing his wife, Joan, to cancer in 2015.

The strain of caring for a loved one with this disease can be enormous, yet the reward of enhancing a loved one's quality of life is beyond measure. So, where to begin? Many books delve into other specific areas of Alzheimer's care, emphasizing the financial and legal challenges, as well as myriad medical treatment needs of those experiencing the disease. Unique among these offerings, At Wit's End explains the psychiatric and psychological aspects of Alzheimer's, and does so in a holistic and practical manner. Kraus focuses on the whole person across his or her full social, psychological, physical, and spiritual life to provide as complete a picture as possible of the changes that are in play. With this broad, thoughtful, and grounded approach, family members, clincians, and caregivers are better able to discover and make wise choices from a wealth of effective interventions in all areas of care. It also allows them to care for themselves and their families in the dynamic, supportive care process. Find out how Alzheimer's can be distinguished from normal aging and other diseases that mimic its symptoms; how the disorder affects changes in functional abilities and how the daily competence of a person with Alzheimer's is viewed by psychiatric and legal communities; how rational thinking is distorted, leading to a wide array of unusual and often uncharacteristic behaviors like agitation, impatience, wandering, and inappropriate expressions of sexuality; and what medical, psychiatric, and psychological treatments are available to help. At Wit's End gives families, clinicians, and caregivers a new outlook on Alzheimer's disease.George Kraus is a psychologist specializing in the care of the elderly, especially those suffering from Alzheimer's disease and other dementias. He is on the faculty of John F. Kennedy University's Department of Clinical Psychology (Pleasant Hill, California) and is in private practice. He has published in a variety of professional and online journals including Clinical Psychology Review, Small Group Research, Psychological Reports, Small Group Behavior, and Psychotherapy.net.Afternoons with PuppyLessons for Life From a Therapist and His AnimalsAubrey H. Fine & Cynthia J. Eisen, Cynthia J. EisenAfternoons with Puppy is a heartwarming account of dynamic relationships and outcomes involving a therapist, his therapy animals, and his patients, gathered from almost two decades of ongoing practice. It is a narrative of Dr. Aubrey H. Fine's experiences and his growing respect for the power of the animals' effects on his patients and himself. Fine observes that healing is rarely, if ever, accomplished in isolation. There is always a reaching out and a connection at the heart of the therapeutic enterprise. Afternoons with Puppy reveals the ways in which our bond with animals centers our being. Interacting with an animal, as simple as having a puppy in your lap gnawing on your thumb, strips away the unimportant and provides the neutral, primal ground on which healing and new growth can take place. Afternoons with Puppy is an emotional journey that will continue long after the last page.Dr. Aubrey H. Fine, a clinical psychologist and a professor at California State Polytechnic University, is an internationally renowned expert on animal-assisted therapy (AAT). He is the editor of the classic book on the subject, The Handbook on Animal Assisted Therapy (first edition, 2000; second edition, 2006), and has published other works in the areas of parent/child relationships, learning/attention disorders, and sports psychology.

Cynthia J. Eisen teaches literature and mentors freshmen students at Nazareth College in Rochester, New York. As a parent, she brings firsthand knowledge of the benefits of animal-assisted therapy for a child with learning disabilities.From Shtetl to StardomJews and HollywoodMichal Renov & Vincent Brook, Vincent BrookThe outsized influence of Jews in American entertainment from the early days of Hollywood to the present has proved an endlessly fascinating and controversial topic, for Jews and non-Jews alike. From Shtetl to Stardom: Jews and Hollywood takes an exciting and innovative approach to this rich and complex material. Exploring the subject from a scholarly perspective as well as up close and personal, the book combines historical and theoretical analysis by leading academics in the field with inside information from prominent entertainment professionals. Essays range from Vincent Brook's survey of the stubbornly persistent canard of Jewish industry "control" to Lawrence Baron and Joel Rosenberg's panel presentations on the recent brouhaha over Ben Urwand's book alleging collaboration between Hollywood and Hitler. Case studies by Howard Rodman and Joshua Louis Moss examine a key Coen brothers film, A Serious Man (Rodman), and Jill Soloway's groundbreaking television series, Transparent (Moss). Jeffrey Shandler and Shaina Hamermann train their respective lenses on popular satirical comedians of yesteryear (Allan Sherman) and those currently all the rage (Amy Schumer, Lena Dunham, and Sarah Silverman). David Isaacs relates his years of agony and hilarity in the television comedy writers' room, and interviews include in-depth discussions by Ross Melnick with Laemmle Theatres owner Greg Laemmle (relative of Universal Studios founder Carl Laemmle) and by Michael Renov with Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner. In all, From Shtetl to Stardom offers a uniquely multifaceted, multimediated, and up-to-the-minute account of the remarkable role Jews have played over the centuries and ongoing in American popular culture.Michael Renov is professor of cinema and media studies and serves as vice dean for Academic Affairs at the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California.

RayIt has become increasingly accepted that important digital data must be retained and shared in order to preserve and promote knowledge, advance research in and across all disciplines of scholarly endeavor, and maximize the return on investment of public funds.   To meet this challenge, colleges and universities are adding data services to existing infrastructures by drawing on the expertise of information professionals who are already involved in the acquisition, management and preservation of data in their daily jobs. Data services include planning and implementing good data management practices, thereby increasing researchers' ability to compete for grant funding and ensuring that data collections with continuing value are preserved for reuse.   This volume provides a framework to guide information professionals in academic libraries, presses, and data centers through the process of managing research data from the planning stages through the life of a grant project and beyond. It illustrates principles of good practice with use-case examples and illuminates promising data service models through case studies of innovative, successful projects and collaborations.Joyce Ray teaches digital preservation and digital curation in the Johns Hopkins University graduate museum studies program.

Weaver, Wilella D. Burgess, Amy L. Childress & Linda Slakey, Wilella D. Burgess, Amy L. Childress, Linda SlakeyHigher education is coming under increasing scrutiny, both publically and within academia, with respect to its ability to appropriately prepare students for the careers that will make them competitive in the 21st-century workplace. At the same time, there is a growing awareness that many global issues will require creative and critical thinking deeply rooted in the technical STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines. However, the existing and ingrained structures of higher education, particularly in the STEM fields, are not set up to provide students with extensive skill development in communication, teamwork, and divergent thinking, which is needed for success in the knowledge economy.In 2011 and again in 2014, an international conference was convened to bring together university leaders, educational policymakers and researchers, and funding agency representatives to discuss the issue of institutional transformation in higher education, particularly in the STEM disciplines. Central to the issue of institutional transformation is the ability to provide new forms of instruction so that students can gain the variety of skills and depth of knowledge they will need. However, radically altering approaches to instruction sets in motion a domino effect that touches on learning space design, instructional technology, faculty training and reward structures, course scheduling, and funding models. In order for one piece to move, there must be coordinated movement in the others, all of which are part of an entrenched and interconnected system.Transforming Institutions brings together chapters from the scholars and leaders who were part of the 2011 and 2014 conferences. It provides an overview of the context and challenges in STEM higher education, contributed chapters describing programs and research in this area, and a reflection and summary of the lessons from the many authors' viewpoints, leading to suggested next steps in the path toward transformation.Gabriela C. Weaver serves as vice provost for faculty development, director of the Center for Teaching and Faculty Development, and professor of chemistry at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.Teaching Engineering, Second EditionPhillip C. Wankat & Frank S. Oreovicz, Frank S. OreoviczThe majority of professors have never had a formal course in education, and the most common method for learning how to teach is on-the-job training. This represents a challenge for disciplines with ever more complex subject matter, and a lost opportunity when new active learning approaches to education are yielding dramatic improvements in student learning and retention. This book aims to cover all aspects of teaching engineering and other technical subjects. It presents both practical matters and educational theories in a format useful for both new and experienced teachers. It is organized to start with specific, practical teaching applications and then leads to psychological and educational theories. The "practical orientation" section explains how to develop objectives and then use them to enhance student learning, and the "theoretical orientation" section discusses the theoretical basis for learning/teaching and its impact on students. Written mainly for PhD students and professors in all areas of engineering, the book may be used as a text for graduate-level classes and professional workshops or by professionals who wish to read it on their own. Although the focus is engineering education, most of this book will be useful to teachers in other disciplines. Teaching is a complex human activity, so it is impossible to develop a formula that guarantees it will be excellent. However, the methods in this book will help all professors become good teachers while spending less time preparing for the classroom. This is a new edition of the well-received volume published by McGraw-Hill in 1993. It includes an entirely revised section on the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and new sections on the characteristics of great teachers, different active learning methods, the application of technology in the classroom (from clickers to intelligent tutorial systems), and how people learn.Phillip C. Wankat is the Clifton L. Lovell Distinguished Professor of Chemical Engineering and Engineering Education at Purdue University. He is interested in separation processes and in improving engineering education. His current research in separation processes focuses on large-scale chromatography and simulated moving bed systems, distillation, and analysis of the engineering education research literature.Essential Readings in Problem-Based LearningExploring and Extending the Legacy of Howard S. BarrowsPeggy A. Ertmer, Andrew Walker, Heather Leary & Cindy Hmelo-Silver, Cindy Hmelo-Silver, Andrew Walker, Heather LearyLike most good educational interventions, problem-based learning (PBL) did not grow out of theory, but out of a practical problem. Medical students were bored, dropping out, and unable to apply what they had learned in lectures to their practical experiences a couple of years later. Neurologist Howard S. Barrows reversed the sequence, presenting students with patient problems to solve in small groups and requiring them to seek relevant knowledge in an effort to solve those problems. Out of his work, PBL was born. The application of PBL approaches has now spread far beyond medical education. Today, PBL is used at levels from elementary school to adult education, in disciplines ranging across the humanities and sciences, and in both academic and corporate settings. This book aims to take stock of developments in the field and to bridge the gap between practice and the theoretical tradition, originated by Barrows, that underlies PBL techniques.Peggy A. Ertmer is a professor of learning design and technology at Purdue University and is the founding editor of the Interdisciplinary Journal of Problem-based Learning.Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, and Animal AbuseLinking the Circles of Compassion for Prevention and InterventionPhil R. Arkow  &  Frank R. Ascione, Frank R. AscioneEvidence is mounting that animal abuse, frequently embedded in families scarred by domestic violence and child abuse and neglect, often predicts the potential for other violent acts. As early intervention is critical in the prevention and reduction of aggression, this boo encourages researchers and professionals to recognize animal abuse as significant problem and a human public-health issue that should be included as a curriculum topic in training. The book is an interdisciplinary sourcebook of original essays that examines the relations between animal maltreatment and human interpersonal violence, expands the scope of research in this growing area, and provides practical assessment and documentation strategies to help professionals confronting violence do their jobs better by attending to these connections. This book brings together, for the first time, all of the leaders in this emerging field. They examine contemporary research and programmatic issues, encourage cross-disciplinary interactions, and describe innovative programs in the field today. The book also includes vivid first-person accounts from <QUOTE>survivors<QUOTE> whose experiences included animal maltreatment among other forms of family violence.Frank Ascione is a professor of psychology and adjunct professor of family, consumer, and human development at Utah State University.

This book tells the compelling story of how its inhabitants (Roman Catholic Poles, Greek Catholic Ukrainians, and Jews) reacted to the sweeping political changes during and after World Wars I and II. The Eastern Front shifted back and forth, and the city changed hands seven times. At the end of each war, L'viv found itself in the hands of a different state. While serious tensions had existed among Poles, Ukrainians/Ruthenians, and Jews in the city, before 1914 eruptions of violence were still infrequent. The changes of political control over the city during World War I led to increased intergroup frictions, new power relations, and episodes of shocking violence, particularly against Jews. The city's incorporation into the independent Polish Republic in November 1918 after a brief period of Ukrainian rule sparked intensified conflict. Ukrainians faced discrimination and political repression under the new government, and Ukrainian nationalists attacked the Polish state. In the 1930s, anti-Semitism increased sharply. During World War II, the city experienced first Soviet rule, then Nazi occupation, and finally Soviet conquest. The Nazis deported and murdered nearly all of the city's large Jewish population, and at the end of the war the Soviet forces expelled the city's Polish inhabitants. Based on archival research conducted in L'viv, Kiev, Warsaw, Vienna, Berlin, and Moscow, as well as an array of contemporary printed sources and scholarly studies, this book examines how the inhabitants of the city reacted to the changes in political control, and how ethnic and national ideologies shaped their dealings with each other. An earlier German version of this volume was published as Kriegserfahrungen in einer multiethnischen Stadt: Lemberg 1914-1947 (2011).Christoph Mick is a professor of history at the University of Warwick, United Kingdom. His research interests include the modern history of Russia and Eastern Europe, especially Poland and the Ukraine.

The book was shortlisted for the Prize "Pro Historia Polonorum" of the Senate of the Republic of Poland for the best book on Polish history published in a foreign language between 2007 and 2011.The Charmed CircleJoseph II and the ‘Five Princesses,’ 1765-1790Rebecca Gates-CoonIn late eighteenth-century Vienna a remarkable coterie of five aristocratic women, popularly known as the "five princesses," achieved social preeminence and acclaim as close associates of the reforming Habsburg Emperor Joseph II. They were Princess Maria Josepha Clary (1728–1801); Princess Maria Sidonia Kinsky (1729–1815); Princess Maria Leopoldine Liechtenstein (1733–1809); Countess, subsequently Princess, Maria Leopoldine Kaunitz (1741–1795); and Princess Maria Eleonore Liechtenstein (1745–1812).  The group assumed a stable form by 1772, by which time Joseph II and two of his closest male associates, Field Marshal Franz Moritz Lacy and Count Franz Xavier Orsini-Rosenberg, had become accepted members of the circle as well. During the Viennese social season, members of the group made their way several times each week to the inner city palace of one of the "Dames," as members of the group called themselves. During the summer months, when the women dispersed to visit country estates in Bohemia and Moravia or to travel, group members corresponded regularly.  These were exciting, restless years in the Habsburg monarchy, as reforms were implemented to help the monarchy withstand threats to its stability and international stature from without and within. With assured access to the emperor and his closest advisors, the Dames enjoyed both a unique view of events and a chance to participate in public affairs (albeit informally and discreetly) as steadfast, acknowledged friends of the emperor. Through analysis of the correspondence of these women and of the published and unpublished commentaries of their contemporaries, this study scrutinizes the activities of this select group of women during the co-regency period (1765–1780) when Joseph shared responsibility with his mother, Maria Theresia, and during Joseph's decade as sole ruler (1780–1790) after Maria Theresia's death—years during which the women enjoyed their special position.Rebecca Gates-Coon is a senior reference specialist in the Social Sciences and Humanities Division of the Library of Congress. She holds a PhD from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and lives in Montgomery County, Maryland. She also is author of The Landed Estates of the Esterhàzy Princes: Hungary during the Reforms of Maria Theresia and Joseph II (1994).Data Information LiteracyLibrarians, Data, and the Education of a New Generation of ResearchersJake Carlson & Lisa R. Johnston, Lisa R. JohnstonGiven the increasing attention to managing, publishing, and preserving research datasets as scholarly assets, what competencies in working with research data will graduate students in STEM disciplines need to be successful in their fields? And what role can librarians play in helping students attain these competencies? In addressing these questions, this book articulates a new area of opportunity for librarians and other information professionals, developing educational programs that introduce graduate students to the knowledge and skills needed to work with research data. The term "data information literacy" has been adopted with the deliberate intent of tying two emerging roles for librarians together. By viewing information literacy and data services as complementary rather than separate activities, the contributors seek to leverage the progress made and the lessons learned in each service area. The intent of the publication is to help librarians cultivate strategies and approaches for developing data information literacy programs of their own using the work done in the multiyear, IMLS-supported Data Information Literacy (DIL) project as real-world case studies. The initial chapters introduce the concepts and ideas behind data information literacy, such as the twelve data competencies. The middle chapters describe five case studies in data information literacy conducted at different institutions (Cornell, Purdue, Minnesota, Oregon), each focused on a different disciplinary area in science and engineering. They detail the approaches taken, how the programs were implemented, and the assessment metrics used to evaluate their impact. The later chapters include the "DIL Toolkit," a distillation of the lessons learned, which is presented as a handbook for librarians interested in developing their own DIL programs. The book concludes with recommendations for future directions and growth of data information literacy. More information about the DIL project can be found on the project's website: datainfolit.org.Jake Carlson is the research data services manager at the University of Michigan Libraries. In this role, he explores the application of the theories, principles, and practices of library science beyond the domain of traditional library work.

This "transcultural" literature is produced by authors who write across cultural and national boundaries. Dagnino's book contains a creative rendition of interviews conducted with five internationally renowned writers-Inez Baranay, Brian Castro, Alberto Manguel, Tim Parks, and Ilija Trojanow-and a critical exegesis reflecting on thematic critical, and stylistic aspects. By studying the selected authors' corpus of work, life experiences, and cultural orientations, Dagnino explores the implicit, often subconscious process of cultural and imaginative metamorphosis that leads transcultural writers and their fictionalized characters beyond ethnic national, racial, or religious loci of identity and identity formation. "The work is a significant contribution to scholorship, for it increases our theoretical awareness of today's literary developments, providing us with critical tools that enable us to approach literary texts with an innovative perspective."-Maurizio Ascari, Universita di Bologna. </P>Arianna Dagnino conducts research on transcultural practices at the University of British Columbia. Her interests in scholarship include the arts and literatures of global mobility, cultural flows, and neonomadism. In addition to numerous articles in English and Italian, Dagnino's book publications include the novel Fossili (2010), inspired by her four years spent in South Africa, and several boks on the impact of sociotecno globalization, including I nuovi nomadi (1996), Uoma (2000). and Jesus Christ Cyberstar (2008).Veterinary Medical School Admission Requirements (VMSAR)2015 Edition for 2016 MatriculationThe Association o f American Medical CollegesFully up-to-date and packed with useful tips and helpful insights, this publication provides a comprehensive overview of the admission process for the national and international veterinary schools that are members of the Association of American Veterinary Medical Colleges (AAVMC).

Weeks, Jr., Sally S. Weeks & George R. Parker, Sally S. WeeksNative Trees of the Midwest is a definitive guide to identifying trees in Indiana and surrounding states, written by three leading forestry experts. Descriptive text explains how to identify every species in any season, and color photographs show all important characteristics. Not only does the book allow the user to identify trees and learn of their ecological and distributional attributes, but it also presents an evaluation of each species relative to its potential ornamental value for those interested in landscaping. Since tree species have diverse values to wildlife, an evaluation of wildlife uses is presented with a degree of detail available nowhere else. This second edition contains a chapter on introduced species that have become naturalized and invasive throughout the region. All accounts have been reviewed and modifications made when necessary to reflect changes in taxonomy, status, or wildlife uses. Keys have been modified to incorporate introduced species.Sally Weeks was born and grew up on a dairy farm near Winamac, Indiana. She received a BSF in wildlife management and an MS in forestry from Purdue University's Department of Forestry and Natural Resources, where she has taught aspects of tree identification for twenty-five years. George Parker is professor emeritus of Forestry and Natural Resources at Purdue University and has studied old growth forests and the dynamics of forest communities.Teaming With Your Therapy DogAnn R. HowieThis book reminds all handlers who work on teaming with their dogs that they must focus on their behavior, not just the animal's. It provides general principles of teamwork that they can apply in their own way to work with their therapy dog. As the author writes, "The book explores a way of being conscious of what you do with and to your therapy dog to support him in his work. It describes functional principles of behavior you can learn and use immediately, independently or together as a package." Using an exciting new methodology, the author outlines several STEPs for teaming with your dog: Speak conversationally, stay in touch with your dog, keep your eyes on your dog, maintain close proximity to your dog, and (most importantly) be fully present.Ann R. Howie began integrating animals into her counseling practice in 1987 and has worked with animals in (human) health care ever since.

A vision that will soon look beyond the challenges of Alzheimer's disease and focus more of our energy on creating moments of joy. When a person has short-term memory loss, his life is made up of moments. But if you think about it, our memory is made up of moments, too. We are not able to create a perfectly wonderful day with someone who has dementia, but it is absolutely attainable to create a perfectly wonderful moment; a moment that puts a smile on their face, a twinkle in their eye, or triggers a memory. Five minutes later, they won't remember what you did or said, but the feeling you left them with will linger.</span><br></p><p><b>Jolene Brackey</b><span> began her career as an interior designer after graduating from Iowa State University. But she soon realized that she derived great joy from helping people improve the interiors of their lives, rather than their homes. When she left her interior design job, the first job available was in an Alzheimer' special care unit as an activity director. She didn't know what Alzheimer's was but she knew she liked older people. Before long, she realized that God had given her a gift. She found ways to create positive outcomes and moments of joy for the individuals with the disease, their loved ones, and professional caregivers. Eager to share her practical solutions and insights, Jolene began speaking at educational seminars. Her message of hope, encouragement-along with generous helpings of humor-was warmly embraced by family members and professional caregivers alike.

StephensWith its easy-to-read writing style, Productivity and Reliability-Based Maintenance Management provides a strong yet practical foundation on Total Productive Maintenance (TPM). This comprehensive practical guide departs from the wait-failure-emergency repair cycle that plagues many industries today. Instead, this text takes a proactive and productive maintenance approach, focusing on how to avoid failure in the first place. By using real-world case studies in every chapter, the author reinforces the importance of sound and proactive maintenance practices. The use of end-of-chapter problems and discussion questions helps to solidify concepts presented. Productivity and Reliability-Based Maintenance Management is a powerful educational tool for students as well as maintenance professionals and managers.

BlissWilliam L. Hershey & John C. Green, John C. GreenRay Bliss was a masterful behind-the-scenes force in the Republican Party for more than three decades at the local, state, and national levels. Recognized as a master of the "nuts and bolts" of practical politics, Bliss was among the first to use polling and television in campaigns. When Bliss took over as national chairman in 1965, the GOP was on life support after Barry Goldwater's landslide defeat in the 1964 presidential election. Bliss rebuilt the party through hard work, innovation, a keen eye for detail, and uncanny political instincts. His shrewd ability to unite liberal, moderate, and conservative Republicans helped put Richard M. Nixon in the White House in 1968. This thorough biography chronicles Bliss's career from campus political czar at the University of Akron, to Akron City Hall, the Ohio Statehouse, and finally the national capital in Washington, DC. It details his complicated relationship with Nixon, who used Bliss's skills to become president, but then forced his resignation as national chairman.William L. Hershey spent more than forty years reporting on Ohio government and politics at the local, state, and national levels before retiring in 2012. He covered nine national political conventions and eight Ohio presidential campaigns. He continues to write on a freelance basis.

In All on One Plate, Dr. Solveig Brown delves into the issues every mother faces. Based on in-depth research, this book reveals the contradictions between our cultural and individual ideals of being a good mother. It shows how mothers experience pressure, guilt, self-judgment, and judgment from others. It recounts how women and couples transition to parenthood, negotiate the division of labor, and decide how to balance making money and caring for children. We often criticize middle-class mothers for being over-involved in their children's lives. Parental involvement has dramatically increased for this generation of mothers because our culture primarily depends on parents to manage the effects of social change on childrearing. This book shows the diverse ways mothers deal with overseeing their children's safety; nutrition, exercise, and body image; screen time and social media; and consumerism, while fostering achievement, and raising good kids. Dr. Brown interweaves candid narratives filled with humor and wisdom, cultural analysis, and the latest research to address the multitude of things American mothers deal with daily. This book will shift our cultural conversation about mothers.Solveig Brown, Ph.D., is an anthropologist who has done extensive research about middle-class American mothers. She has conducted in-depth interviews and focus groups with mothers, gathered survey data, and completed an extensive review of the academic literature relevant to the issues American parents deal with on a daily basis. She has contributed to Stay at Home Mothers: An International Perspective, and Intensive Mothering: The Cultural Contradictions of Modern Motherhood. Brown has presented her research on mothers to academic audiences and parent groups. She lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota with her family.Landesman’s JournalMeditations of a Forest PhilosopherRichard SchainLandesman's Journal is the intellectual journal of the ongoing search of a highly perceptive philosopher who has left civilization for contemplation in the forest. The author philosophically and rationally explains metaphysics and his intuitions of the soul with post-modern sophistication. He advances the thought of some of his most influential predecessors: Berdyaev, Emerson, William James, Pessoa, Senancour, Thoreau and, Nietzsche. The depth, intensity, and fluency of his writing steadily increase as the journal progresses. In his view, dogmatic religions and one-dimensional scientism are the main barriers to spiritual development. Landesman was a lightfooted philosopher, the type Nietzsche had recommended for philosophy, but who is rarely found. One might paraphrase Walt Whitman by saying, "He who touches this book touches a philosopher."The author obtained A.B. (philosophy) and M.D. degrees from New York University. He trained in neurology at the Yale Medical Center, later serving as professor of neurology and psychiatry at UCLA. He embarked on his life as an independent philosopher in 1980 with the writing of Affirmations of Reality (1982) and Philosophical Artwork (1983). Later writings include Souls Exist (1989, 2013), The Legend of Nietzsche's Syphilis (2001), Reverence for the Soul (2001), Behold the Philosopher (2007), Interior Lights (2012), and Toward an Existential Philosophy of the Soul (2014). Essays appearing in the electronic journal 'Philosophy Pathways' were published as Radical Metaphysics (2002) and In Love with Eternity (2006). All Schain's philosophical writings deal with the significance of the interior self, which is called the soul. Richard Schain was awarded Foreword Reviews' 2014 INDIEFAB Book of the Year Award, Silver, in Philosophy.The Saint and the PigA Dream and How St. Antonius Is InvolvedRegina Abt-BaechiSaint Anthony and the pig— at first glance and odd pairing of opposites! Antonius, also known as Antonius "the Great", has acquired legendary status as a personality seeking to reconcile the psychic opposites that were polarized as a result of the Christian viewpoint. In her work, which owes its origins to a dream, the author explores the symbolic importance of this figure and his attributes. On the basis of the psychology of C.G. Jung and M.-L. von Franz, she examines and interprets the legends and iconography of the saint with the pig. There are reference to this day and age and the spiritual reality of modern man, which give the work an unexpectedly contemporary relevance. This book is an extended revision of the original version.Regina Abt (1945), born in Zürich, Switzerland, has a masters degree in European Ethnology, History of Religion and Folk Literature and is a Jungian analyst, a graduate of the C.G. Jung Institut in Küsnacht. She has been in private practice since 1985 and lectures at the Research and Training Center for Depth Psychology according to C.G. Jung and M.-L. von Franz, at the C.G. Jung Institute in Küsnacht. She is Co-author of Dream Child (2000), author of Animals and Animal Dreams (2011) and various other publications in German and English.Could You Please, Please Stop Singing?Sabyasachi NagIn Could You Please, Please Stop Singing, Sabyasachi (Sachi) Nag takes a step away from skepticism, blending humour with shock and surprise, seeking a return to childhood in "Mamuda's Fries," innocence in "Conversations with the Country Activist" and fractals for the future in the yet to be invented "Seedless Avocado." In attempting what Tomas Transromer calls "walking through walls," Nag hurts and sickens himself with awe and rage. The title poem "Could You Please, Please Stop Singing" purposely evokes the famous Hemingway line from Men Without Women and is central to the overall tonality of this collection, that straddles a path alternately mocking and dead serious, and that occasionally yields to contrary pulls between the banal and the sublime.Sabyasachi (Sachi) Nag's first collection of poems, Bloodlines, was published in 2006. He lives in Mississauga with his wife and son. Nag immigrated to Canada from Calcutta, where he was born, and many of the poems in this collection are about this city. The city's voices offer a wide cast of characters, ranging from the cotton fluffer, the graffitist, the house help, the processionist, the busker and the bomb maker. These voices all earnestly seek to explain and answer, discovering what they feared was lost. In that respect, Nag's poems are about voyaging into emptiness and returning with a piece of cloud mistook for cotton candy.B2B Data-Driven MarketingSources, Uses, ResultsRuth P. Stevens, Theresa C.

Dubai is one of those for me, but not just me—millions around the world yearn to come to Dubai. This global supercity, which just five decades ago was a cholera-plagued backwater, might just be the picture of a dream becoming reality. But how, exactly, did this incredible transformation take place? Leadership! But not your run-of-the-mill government leadership, nor typical corporate leadership, nor leadership taught in classrooms. This is Dubai-style leadership. Living and working in Dubai for the past decade, I've seen the leadership impact firsthand. As a leadership scholar and advisor to CEOs, I thought I was perfectly situated to discover the reasons behind Dubai's success. So, in 2008 I set out to discover the city's "secret sauce." Then the Global Financial Crisis hit! Disaster! I pressed the pause button on my research, and, like everyone in the city, held my breath. Well, what happened next confirmed that there is indeed something unique and special here. I spent the next three years researching, interviewing more than two hundred leaders, and identifying the city's leadership secrets, eventually whittling them down to twelve habits. My aim was to develop a replicable model that I could share with my readers—leaders in businesses, governments, and elsewhere. Anyone who is interested in leadership, and in particular achieving exceptional results, can benefit from understanding the twelve habits I outline here. To learn how to lead Dubai style, we need to walk the desert paths of the past to the superhighways of the future. Leadership Dubai Style retraces the city's journey and draws out the leadership habits that emerged over time. For decades Dubai brought in—imported—leading minds from every field to learn from them.

It is a defenseless location of exposure and limitation, a point where people face real threats. Today, people face serious difficulties in their marriages, with their kids, in their communities, in the nation, and across the globe. Quite often, the situation seems hopeless… but it’s not.In this book, Wilfredo De Jesús (known as Pastor Choco) gives nine examples of courageous people in the Scriptures—men and women who recognized the warning signs and trusted God to use them to make a difference. With clarity, power, and warmth, Pastor Choco points us to Jesus as the ultimate example and resource. As we taste the grace and greatness of God, our hearts will be transformed, and He will give us the courage to step into the gaps around us.And then, the world—our families, our communities, our nation, and the farthest corners of the globe—will experience God’s grace and greatness, too.Widely known as “Pastor Choco,” Wilfredo De Jesús is the senior pastor of New Life Covenant Church in Chicago. Under Pastor Choco’s leadership, New Life Covenant is the largest church in the Assemblies of God fellowship.Wilfredo was born and raised in Chicago’s Humboldt Park community. When he was seventeen years old, he received Jesus as his Lord and Savior at a small Pentecostal Spanish-speaking church in the community. From that moment, his life was forever transformed.He remained in that same little church for over twenty years before he was appointed Senior Pastor in July 2000. Since then, the church has grown from a weekly attendance of 120 to 17,000 globally through church plants and more than 130 ministries reaching the most disenfranchised—the brokenhearted, poor, homeless, prostitutes, drug addicts, and gang members.Rev. De Jesús has been instrumental in the development of several community-based programs such as New Life Family Services, which operates a homeless shelter for women with children. Some of the church’s other vital ministries include the Chicago Master’s Commission, an intensive discipleship program for college-age students, and the Chicago Dream Center, which offers various programs and services to assist individuals and families to move toward self-sufficiency and to overcome poverty and its ill effects.Wilfredo’s vision is simple: to be a church for the hurting that reaches people for Jesus.In 2012, he released his first book, Amazing Faith, in which he shares his life story and message: “No one is beyond the transforming power of God’s love. When we let Him, God fills our hearts with His love, strength, and purpose, and we become complete.”The Joy of SigningSecond EditionLottie L.

In that sense, we are all dying daily—dying is how Christians live. We die to ourselves, our wills, our comforts, and our reputations for the glory of Jesus.

He taught Latin, Greek and modern languages at several universities and could hold religious services in several languages. Nelson came to know Christ at age eleven. After many years as a Baptist minister, Nelson was baptized in the Holy Spirit. This experience and his solid belief in the authority of God's Word led him to embrace Pentecostalism.

Their distinctly different personalities and policies led to 28 years of bitter political rivalry. For the first time, this book provides the full story of their rivalry and its origins, comparing the upbringing, education and personalities of the two leaders, as well as their political careers. Dick Leonard considers the impact of religion on the two men, their contrasting oratorical skills, their attitudes to political and social reform, foreign affairs and imperialism as well as their relations with Queen Victoria. In their private lives he sheds new light on Gladstone's guilt-ridden obsession with 'reforming' prostitutes, and Disraeli's almost completely successful efforts to conceal the existence of two illegitimate children. Providing important new perspectives on the two towering political characters of the Victorian Age, this book will be essential reading for anyone interested in nineteenth century British history and politics.Dick Leonard is an historian, journalist and author and a former Labour MP. For many years he was Assistant Editor of The Economist, and headed their office in Brussels, where he was later also correspondent of The Observer. He also worked for the BBC, and contributed regularly to leading newspapers across the world.

It explores the part that Rama and Arguedas played in the conceptualization and promotion of new cultural spaces made possible by commodification and industrialization, as capitalism transformed the imaginaries and materialities that had shaped their cultural projects for Andean and Latin American cultures. Through a material analysis of print culture objects, in particular those resulting from Rama's editorial ventures—such as pocket paperbacks and a popular encyclopedia—this work examines the transformations occurring at the time in Latin America at the level of production and circulation of culture, and thus sheds light on the emergence of new networks of communication between intellectuals and national and regional publics. Similarly, it explores the role of emergent communication technologies (sound recording and radio) in the reshaping of rural indigenous cultures into a mass-oriented popular culture in Peru. In this context, Arguedas's work with folklore and his later involvement in the Andean popular music scene in Lima are studied as responses to a violent process of commercialization of traditional Andean musical culture, a result of mass migration from rural areas to cities and urbanization. Finally, this book presents an understanding of Rama and Arguedas that transcends their categorization as literary critic and writer, respectively, by analyzing their work through the concept of practice, which encompasses the totality of their work, including journalism, anthropology, folklore, editorial work, intellectual networking, and cultural promotion. Its chapters invite a rethinking of established notions of the relation between culture and capitalism during the heyday of revolution in the Latin American intellectual field.Javier García Liendo is an assistant professor of Spanish at Washington University in St. Louis. He received his PhD in Latin American literatures and cultures from Princeton University, and also holds a BA in Peruvian and Latin American literature from the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (Peru). Before his doctoral studies, he worked and conducted research on orality and literacy in the Peruvian Amazon. His research centers on Andean literature and culture, Latin American intellectual and cultural history, immigration, and mass culture.Anatomía del desencantoHumor, Ficción Y Melancolía En España (1976-1998)Santiago Morales-RiveraAfter the failure of the soixante-huitards, the collapse of European communism, and the fall around 1989 of various dictatorships and revolutions in Latin America, the sentimental approach to history is again reaping successes among the humanities and the social and political sciences. In the Hispanic world, this "affective turn" is on its way to repeating another fin de siècle like the one led by the intellectuals of 1898. A century later, in both Spanish and Anglo-Saxon universities, notions such as disenchantment, trauma, memory, and empathy inform virtually all the analyses of modern Spanish culture, from the bloody Civil War and the nearly forty years of fascism that followed it to the disappointing transition to democracy. Santiago Morales intervenes in this sentimental approach to history and to the novelistic production of the transition by recovering the links and tensions that the notion of melancholy maintains with the aesthetics of black humor in a corpus of fictional works written between 1976 and 1998. Through a methodology that alternates between the careful analysis of novels by Javier Marías, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, Cristina Fernández Cubas, and Juan José Millás, and the distant reading or framing that places these texts in a broader history, Anatomía del desencanto constructs a critique of the equivocal place held in our modern age by feelings that were, in another time, so noble and persistent, such as grief, fear, guilt, and compassion. While other specialists who study the transition today agree in denouncing the ominous persistence of Francoism and the postwar ethos, Santiago Morales sees a deeply ironic formula in the black humor of melancholy: a catalyst in the creative and moral growth of Spanish narrative and a fundamental critical tool to change contemporary sentimental education. Written entirely in Spanish. Tras la derrota de los soixante-huitards, el colapso del comunismo europeo y la caída también en torno a 1989 de varias dictaduras y revoluciones en América Latina, el acercamiento sentimental a la historia vuelve a cosechar éxitos entre las humanidades y las ciencias sociales y políticas. En el ámbito hispánico, este "giro afectivo" lleva camino de reproducir otro fin de siècle como el que ya protagonizaron los intelectuales de 1898. Un siglo después, tanto en las universidades españolas como en las anglosajonas nociones como desencanto, trauma, memoria, y empatía informan prácticamente todos los análisis de la cultura española moderna, desde la sanguinaria guerra civil y los casi cuarenta años de fascismo hasta la decepcionante transición a la democracia. Santiago Morales interviene en este acercamiento sentimental a la historia y a la novelística de la transición, recuperando los vínculos y tensiones que mantiene la noción de melancolía con la estética del humor negro en un corpus de obras de ficción escritas entre 1976 y 1998. Mediante una metodología que alterna entre el análisis cuidadoso de novelas de Javier Marías, Gonzalo Torrente Ballester, Cristina Fernández Cubas y Juan José Millás, y el distant reading o el encuadre que coloca estos textos en una historia más amplia, Anatomía del desencanto hace una crítica del lugar equívoco que ocupan en nuestra modernidad sentimientos en otro tiempo tan nobles y obstinados como el duelo, el miedo, la culpa, y la compasión. Mientras que otros estudiosos de la transición abundan en denunciar la persistencia ominosa del franquismo y la posguerra, Santiago Morales ve en el humor negro de la melancolía una fórmula profundamente irónica: un catalizador en el crecimiento creativo y moral de la narrativa española y una herramienta crítica fundamental para cambiar la educación sentimental contemporánea. Escrito en espanõl.Santiago Morales Rivera received his PhD from Harvard University and is currently an assistant professor in the Department of Spanish and Portuguese at the University of California–Irvine.

Eso es lo que te propone este libro: resetear las ideas y costumbres que se han quedado obsoletas en el ecosistema laboral actual para dar paso a decisiones que mejoren nuestra empleabilidad ahora y en el futuro. Hay multitud de cuestiones que te afectarán como trabajador, al igual que a las empresas. ¿De qué manera influirá que en 2050 la media de edad de los europeos sea de 52 años frente a los 37 actuales? ¿Qué supondrá en todo el mundo la irrupción laboral de los países emergentes? En 2033, el 66% de la población activa pertenecerá a la generación millennial, con sus valores, talentos, ideales y pretensiones, ¿de qué manera afectará esto a otras generaciones? Por no hablar de que el 47% de los empleos actuales, en 20 años, serán sustituidos por máquinas, software y robots. ¿Estamos preparados? Quienes mejor se adapten a este entorno laboral cambiante será quienes adopten cuanto antes una mentalidad knowmad: neologismo que combina las palabras know (conocer) y nomad (nómada) y que tiene su razón de ser en la innovación y la flexibilidad. El trabajador del conocimiento es el trabajador del futuro. Un tipo de profesional que supone la evolución –más sofisticada y completa– de casi todos los otros perfiles laborales, como autónomo, freelance, emprendedor o autoempleado. Cualquier persona, desde un alto directivo o empresario hasta el empleado de primera línea, puede y debe ser knowmad. Y no es una moda pasajera porque va a ser el tipo de profesional que más crezca y se desarrolle en el futuro cercano. «Para el año 2020, proyectamos que el 45% de nosotros será nómada del conocimiento, convirtiendo este perfil profesional en el mayor segmento de la fuerza laboral. En este libro, Raquel Roca ofrece una mirada crítica a las transformaciones por las que nos conduce la sociedad nómada y ofrece vías y herramientas para la adaptación y el liderazgo en este nuevo paradigma.

De hecho Decathlon ha conseguido que mucha gente practique deporte, o IKEA que muchos redecoren y actualicen sus casas aunque no sean los número uno del diseño interior. A lo largo de todos estos años he vivido la preocupación de multitud de directivos que me expresaban durante los seminarios y talleres cuestiones como: "Y si nosotros no contamos con un Steve Jobs al frente de nuestra organización, ¿qué podemos hacer?" "Si estamos al frente de un proyecto importante y no contamos con un líder carismático que lo defienda, ¿qué podemos hacer?" "¿Cómo hacer frente a la multitud de agentes distintos que afectan en nuestro devenir?, porque claro, mi proyecto es complejo y difícil de entender…"Doctora en Management Sciences, Loreto Rubio es Socia Directora de Sinergia Value, equipo dedicado en exclusiva a trabajar en el LIDERAZGO, la SOCIALIZACIÓN y la gobernanza de PUBLIC AFFAIRES.

<P>"Knowledge and expertise are highly valued in today's business world. These values are introduced at an early age by our education system, and at work, we are assessed based on what we know, on having the answers and solutions. Our need for certainty, to know what's going on, to have all the answers, exerts strong pressure in our lives. This award-winning book offers an alternative, contrarian approach to dealing with such pressures - and to embrace "not knowing" rather than fearing it. The authors argue it is by "not knowing" that we in fact develop an exploratory mindset, and we discover, engage and create new ways to deal with business and management problems and issues. The book is supported by stories of individuals and the positive change they made in their lives through "not knowing". Solving new problems with old ways of thinking are no longer useful in the new world."</P><B>

And yet, just being, or wanting to be creative is not enough—it is essential to train and develop this ability in order to achieve results. In other words, we need a guide to show us the way and provide us with the tools needed to progress. 'Designpedia' is an essential manual for Design Thinking which brings together all the tools you need to achieve innovation and entrepreneurship goals and organized around four basic processes: mapping, exploring, building and testing. It also reveals how, as long as you use the right tools, you can create original and effective solutions.

Íñigo FernándezUn libro para comprender cómo el bloque en conjunto de los humanos pudo sobrevivir desde la mismísima prehistoria hasta los días de hoy, en la actualidad. Un libro en el que lo que menos aparece son reyes, fechas y datos áridos que cualquier persona puede consultar en una enciclopedia. Este repaso global es la vibrante narración de cómo unos seres que parecían abocados al desastre cuando eran meros primates en las selvas de África, consiguieron convertirse mediante su inteligencia y superación a través de todos los años de vida, en la clase dominante por encima de todos sus vecinos naturales." La trepidante historia de la humanidad, desde las primeras tribus a las megalópolis actuales, contada esta vez desde el punto de vista de los gobernados, no de los gobernantes. Unánimemente se ha tratado la historia universal atendiendo a dos factores que desvirtúan un poco la perspectiva global del devenir de la humanidad: la perspectiva de los gobernantes y la perspectiva de Europa. Al tratar los avatares que han llevado al homo sapiens a la Luna o a las fosas abisales más profundas, la mayoría de historiadores olvidan que los hombres corrientes son verdaderos agentes de la historia y no meros objetos al servicio de los gobernantes, también olvidan que existen reinos e imperios más allá de las fronteras de Europa que han influido de un modo determinante en la humanidad: Breve Historia del Mundo viene a ofrecer una visión que huya de esos clichés y presente una historia universal concreta y novedosa.Luis Íñigo Fernández nació en Guadalajara en 1966.

Acérquese a la historia de los dirigibles, aquellos colosos del aire que surcaron los cielos el siglo pasado y descubra por qué están tan asociados al invento del noble alemán Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Descubra la evolución histórica del dirigible y de los extraordinarios personajes que estuvieron vinculados a este medio aéreo, desde su inicial empleo bélico hasta su actual papel como aeronave que puede asumir facetas complementarias de la aviación. Conozca cómo eran las misiones de combate de los dirigibles en la Primera Guerra Mundial, las grandes tragedias de los dirigibles de posguerra, los lujos y comodidades que disfrutaron los exclusivos pasajeros de estos transatlánticos del aire y la enorme complejidad técnica que implicó su desarrollo. Carlos Lázaro ofrece al lector una visión general sobre el dirigible, cuya aparición está estrechamente relacionada con la evolución de la técnica y la mentalidad de Europa y América en la primera mitad del siglo XX. Descubra por qué hoy en día los dirigibles, después del famoso desastre del Hindenburg, siguen siendo aeronaves susceptibles de ser empleadas en diversas facetas útiles para la humanidad, como alternativa aérea en campos como la ecología, la seguridad y el transporte aéreo.Carlos Lázaro es Doctor en Antropología de América.

Hazañas memorables, circunstancias inverosímiles y buques desaparecidos. Desde el Mary Celeste, el submarino U-31 y el portaviones Invincible hasta sucesos propios de leyendas marinas, sin olvidar al gato Oskar, que tripuló varios navíos durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Descubra las historias más entrañables o desgarradoras, trágicas o enigmáticas, pero siempre interesantes, experiencias en las que el azar y las circunstancias nos demuestran que a veces, en este mundo, la imperante rutina puede ser tan sólo la excepción. Asómbrese con los barcos que aparecieron sin sus tripulantes, colisiones a pleno día de buques dirigidos por profesionales, submarinos que regresaron del pasado o de la tumba por condicionantes técnicos o propósitos inconfesables, varadas simultáneas de flotillas enteras de buques, un pescador que se convierte en el único hombre en ver caer una bomba atómica y pescar un submarino, tesoros emprendiendo viajes de ida y vuelta o modernos buques que intentan pasar a través de tierra.

La épica aventura de una escuadra española en una expedición científica sin precedentes. Una vuelta al mundo trescientos años después de la primera circunnavegación de Magallanes-Elcano. Un viaje a lugares remotos y exóticos, misterio, motines y temporales, conspiraciones y enigmas filosóficos. Una epopeya naval contada con gran rigor histórico. Invierno de 1795. Dos fragatas se preparan en Cádiz para zarpar rumbo al lejano océano Pacífico e iniciar una nueva expedición a las órdenes de Ignacio María de Álava. Su destino: las islas Filipinas. La vida en un barco, sus luchas internas, motines, temporales y batallas. Una iniciación a la vida, a la vez que todo un relato histórico. Invierno de 1795. Poco después de que España haya firmado la paz con el Directorio surgido de la Revolución francesa, una escuadra española de tres navíos de 74 cañones y dos fragatas se prepara en Cádiz para zarpar rumbo al lejano océano Pacífico. Su destino: las islas Filipinas. Allí, el gobierno de Godoy quiere reforzar la flota naval al observar la presencia naval británica en la orilla de enfrente, Cantón, sobre la costa China. A bordo del Europa, se han embarcado dos aparatos revolucionarios: el barómetro para predecir temporales y un cronómetro o reloj exacto para hallar la longitud, que convierten la aventura en apasionante expedición científica. Un ilustrado de la Academia de Ciencias de París, monsieur Jean de Nemours, acompañado de su pupilo y sirviente, un joven muchacho llamado Jacques Pirou, se encargará de su manejo y mantenimiento. A través de los ojos de Jacques, el lector verá desfilar no sólo la épica aventura de quienes lograron la completa circunnavegación en 1802, sino las increíbles operaciones sucedidas en Filipinas, su supervivencia a dos tifones, y un recorrido por otras expediciones transpacíficas y circunnavegadoras precedentes.Víctor San Juan (Madrid, 1963), ingeniero, escritor y navegante titulado, ha publicado anteriormente ensayos como 'Trafalgar, tres armadas en combate' (2005) con ocasión del bicentenario de dicho evento y que le supuso la concesión de la Medalla San Telmo de la Fundación Letras de La Mar en 2006; 'La batalla naval de las Dunas.

Italia, sede en esos momentos del poder temporal de la Iglesia, era una región débil políticamente y rica para atraer la voracidad de las grandes monarquías europeas.La batalla de Pavía, el Saco de Roma, la invasión de Saboya y las posteriores alianzas matrimoniales fueron los principales hitos que protagonizó Carlos I, futuro emperador del Sacro Imperio. El control del Milanesado, del Reino de Navarra ponen en jaque a las dos mayores potencias mundiales: Francia y España que ansían coronarse como grandes Imperios. Carlos I apoya su ejército gracias a las alianzas de sus hermanas con algunos de los grandes reyes de Europa (Dinamarca, Portugal,…).Nada parece frenar al emperador en la pugna por los derechos de la corona de Nápoles y del ducado de Milán, que se convirtió en el epicentro en torno al que se animaban todos los combates de una de las épocas más apasionantes de la historia de Europa.Antonio Muñoz Lorente (Badalona, 1966).

Ocho Lecciones de Vida de un Empresario ImprobableGary G. Schoeniger & Clifton L. Taulbert, Clifton L. TaulbertA finales de los anos 50, Glen Allan Mississippi era una comunidad algodonera muy pobre. Para muchos, era un tiempo y lugar donde las oportunidades eran limitadas por normas sociales y legales que estaban fuera de su control. Era un tiempo y lugar en donde pocos se atrevían a soñar. Para la mayoría el trabajo estaba en el campo, donde el sol era ardiente, los días largos y la paga muy poca. Era una forma de vida aceptada que se había transmitido de generación en generación, y desde el momento en que el joven Clifton Taulbert pudo caminar, se esperaba que él también se subiera en el camión del Señor Walters y encontrara un lugar entre sus compañeros. Sin embargo, un hombre marcó la diferencia,un empresario improbable que desafió lo convencional y se atrevió a soñar.

Ese hombre era Cleve, el tío de Clifton. ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo? Es la historia de un hombre ordinario con la habilidad para sobreponerse a sus circunstancias y alcanzar una vida mejor. Basado en su propia experiencia de vida, el nominado al premio Pulitzer, Clifton Taulbert forma equipo con el líder empresarial Gary Schoeniger, para crear una historia poderosa y convincente que captura la esencia de la mentalidad empresarial y las ilimitadas oportunidades que esta puede ofrecer. A partir de las lecciones de vida que obtuvo de su Tío Cleve, ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo?, describe la travesía de Taulbert desde su vida en el Delta del Mississippi, en la cúspide de la segregación legal, hasta ser considerado por la revista Time como uno de los más reconocidos empresarios emergentes de los Estados Unidos. Mientras Taulbert describe la influencia transformadora del Tio Cleve en su vida, Schoeniger captura las lecciones de vida emprendedora y las oportunidades ilimitadas que éstas pueden proveer. ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo? Llega al pasado para recordarnos los principios universales y atemporales que pueden empoderar a cualquiera para triunfar.Author and entrepreneur Gary Schoeniger has emerged as an internationally recognized thought leader in the field of entrepreneurial mindset education and training. Drawing from more than 15 years of research, Schoeniger has developed entrepreneurial education and training programs for academic, corporate, government, and non-government clients worldwide including the Cisco Entrepreneur Institute and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Schoeniger led the design and development of the Ice House Entrepreneurship Program through a partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.El poder de la pasiónBelarmino García«Sin riesgo, no hay diversión». Este lema le dio fuerza a Belarmino García para salir de la zona de confort y liderar un proyecto que muchos expertos daban por fallido antes de nacer. Con un equipo de jóvenes aguerridos y ganas de comerse el mundo, Amena saltó al mercado en 1999 e hizo frente a dos gigantes de las telecomunicaciones rompiendo el statu quo. El autor cuenta en este libro que a priori no existen situaciones predeterminadas. ¿Por qué un tercer operador no puede ser más rápido y ágil que sus competidores? ¿Por qué un nuevo jugador no puede reescribir las reglas de juego del mercado? ¿Por qué hay que contentarse con alcanzar una cima sin cuestionar que pueden existir otras más altas? Estas son algunas de las preguntas que se formuló aquel equipo que impactó al mercado con una marca de gran valor para nuestro país. A través de la gestión de las personas y una firme defensa de la innovación; en una carrera contrarreloj, sin miedo, con esfuerzo y mucho trabajo, pero, sobre todo, con mucha Pasión, alcanzaron cimas inimaginables.Belarmino García es ingeniero técnico de Telecomunicaciones, máster en Dirección Comercial y Marketing y diplomado en Dirección y Administración de Empresas. De sus primeras actividades de carácter más técnico, enseguida pasó a ejercer como ejecutivo en las áreas de ventas, marketing y dirección de negocios y empresas, trabajando en compañías como HP, Siemens Nixdorf, Amena, France Telecom o Zeerca. En la actualidad, su foco principal reside en gestionar su tiempo hacía lo que ama, incluyendo, entre otras cosas, recuperar momentos tan especiales como los vividos en Amena, que han sido fuente de inspiración y creación de este libro. También, compartir su experiencia y asesorar en la gestión de negocio o colaborar con una asociación sin ánimo de lucro como voluntario senior, ofreciendo su experiencia y conocimientos en gestión empresarial a quienes lo demanden.El consejo 2020Diccionario LID Finanzas clarasCreating Moments of Joy Along the Alzheimer's JourneyA Guide for Families and Caregivers, Fifth Edition, Revised and ExpandedJolene Brackey<p>Author Jolene Brackey has a vision: to help families, caregivers, and people with Alzheimer's disease create joy together in the face of one of the most devastating diseases in the world today. </p><p>When people have short-term memory loss, their lives are made up of moments.

Una rigurosa crónica de la peripecia personal, plagada de aventuras, del genial autor de El Quijote, obra cumbre de la literatura universal y figura clave del Siglo de Oro. Conozca a Miguel de Cervantes, autor del Quijote e inventor de la novela moderna. Acérquese a una obra que plantea aspectos de la vida del autor que sin duda le sorprenderán. La cautividad en Argel, sus encontronazos con Lope y su deseo de ser un gran autor de comedias, las acusaciones de asesinato hacia su familia, su huida a Sevilla. Un personaje complejo, pero con una grandeza humana que logra reflejar en su obra más afamada. José Miguel Cabañas, con un escrupuloso rigor histórico y empleando las más recientes investigaciones, le descubrirá aspectos de la vida y la personalidad de un hombre que aún no están nada claros, pero que nos muestran un Cervantes distinto al que hasta ahora se nos había enseñado. Un hombre, que bien podría ser el protagonista de una novela de aventuras que parece que no se supo o no se quiso adaptar a los convencionalismos sociales y culturales de su épocaJosé Miguel Cabañas Agrela es licenciado en Geografía e Historia por la Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Experto en la segunda mitad del siglo XVI español y europeo, ha centrado su trabajo en el estudio de las relaciones internacionales y diplomáticas entre la España de Felipe II y la Inglaterra de Isabel I a través de la figura del embajador español en esa corte, don Bernardino de Mendoza (embajador, escritor, soldado y espía), un personaje muy completo y cuya trayectoria le situó siempre en los centros neurálgicos del poder y de los acontecimientos más importantes del reinado de Felipe II. Autor de Don Bernardino de Mendoza, un escritor-soldado al servicio de la monarquía católica (1541-1604) y de Reyes sodomitas, donde se narra la vida y las pasiones de una serie de monarcas de la Europa del Renacimiento y del Barroco cuya reputación de haber tenido preferencia por el mismo sexo se inició ya desde el mismo momento de sus respectivos reinados. Historiador polifacético, se atreve con cualquier tema narrando la historia como si la hubiese vivido, con gran rigor histórico e intelectual, pero con un lenguaje sencillo y directo que engancha. Colaborador habitual en la revista 'La Aventura de la Historia y en el Diccionario Biográfico Español' (RAH), donde redactó las biografías de varios personajes clave de la monarquía de Felipe II.Breve historia de la literatura españolaAlberto de Frutos DávalosUna completa historia de la literatura española desde sus orígenes hasta la actualidad: Las jarchas, el mester de clerecía, el romance, los pícaros y el Conde Lucanor para llegar al Quijote, Quevedo, Góngora, la poesía social, la generación del 98, Gerardo Diego, Lorca y hasta Francisco Umbral, Mayorga y el desarrollo de las nuevas tecnologías.

Malik, que la lleva al límite del deseo. Se atraen desde el mismo instante que 
se conocen, pero mientras él no cesa en sus intentos de seducirla, ella evita 
caer en sus redes. Juntos son una bomba de relojería, pero separados sus 
corazones son incapaces de latir. ¿Hasta cuándo podrá resistirse Sofía a los 
deseos más íntimos y salvajes que Kilam despierta en ella? Juntos eran una bomba 
de relojería, pero separados, sus corazones eran incapaces de latir. Una llamada 
inesperada. Ese cantante de rap con letras tan agresivas y gestos tan duros, 
quiere contratar tus servicios. Su aspecto y el de la gente que le rodea resulta 
tan intimidante que te gustaría salir huyendo, pero hay algo en él, en lo más 
profundo de su mirada, que te paraliza y te atrae cada vez más hacia él. Te 
provoca con sus palabras, con sus gestos, con sus actos. No puedes controlarlo. 
Es impulsivo, espontáneo y tan intenso que aunque quieres alejarte de él, algo 
más fuerte que tú y que él, comienza a nacer en vosotros sin que podáis hacer 
nada para impedirlo. Le deseas, le deseas tanto que te duele. Quieres ser la 
dueña de su cuerpo, de sus gemidos, de su sexo y de su aliento. Tienes miedo, lo 
que sientes por él es cada vez más fuerte. ¿Le amas?, ¿qué es amar?, él te 
quiere, sí, te quiere, te lo ha dicho. Pero otro acto explosivo te lleva a 
millones de kilómetros de distancia de tu corazón. Solo una canción, su mejor 
verso, será capaz de conquistar tu corazón.<br></p><p>Cova Galena es el seudónimo tras el que se esconde una escritora gallega que

España y Francia en guerra: Uno de los conflictos más decisivos de la Modernidad. El Imperio español, la etapa de mayor esplendor cultural y político de España, comienza a cimentarse cuando Carlos de Gante (Carlos I de España y V del Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico) se enfrenta a un joven rey de Francia, Francisco I, para luchar por la supremacía en el continente europeo.En los primeros años del siglo XVI Carlos I se enfrenta duramente a Francisco I de Francia. El objetivo: controlar gran parte del territorio italiano de cara a convertirse en el primer gran emperador de Europa. Italia, sede en esos momentos del poder temporal de la Iglesia, era una región débil políticamente y rica para atraer la voracidad de las grandes monarquías europeas.La batalla de Pavía, el Saco de Roma, la invasión de Saboya y las posteriores alianzas matrimoniales fueron los principales hitos que protagonizó Carlos I, futuro emperador del Sacro Imperio. El control del Milanesado, del Reino de Navarra ponen en jaque a las dos mayores potencias mundiales: Francia y España que ansían coronarse como grandes Imperios. Carlos I apoya su ejército gracias a las alianzas de sus hermanas con algunos de los grandes reyes de Europa (Dinamarca, Portugal,…).Nada parece frenar al emperador en la pugna por los derechos de la corona de Nápoles y del ducado de Milán, que se convirtió en el epicentro en torno al que se animaban todos los combates de una de las épocas más apasionantes de la historia de Europa.Antonio Muñoz Lorente (Badalona, 1966).

Ocho Lecciones de Vida de un Empresario ImprobableGary G. Schoeniger & Clifton L. Taulbert, Clifton L. TaulbertA finales de los anos 50, Glen Allan Mississippi era una comunidad algodonera muy pobre. Para muchos, era un tiempo y lugar donde las oportunidades eran limitadas por normas sociales y legales que estaban fuera de su control. Era un tiempo y lugar en donde pocos se atrevían a soñar. Para la mayoría el trabajo estaba en el campo, donde el sol era ardiente, los días largos y la paga muy poca. Era una forma de vida aceptada que se había transmitido de generación en generación, y desde el momento en que el joven Clifton Taulbert pudo caminar, se esperaba que él también se subiera en el camión del Señor Walters y encontrara un lugar entre sus compañeros. Sin embargo, un hombre marcó la diferencia,un empresario improbable que desafió lo convencional y se atrevió a soñar.

Ese hombre era Cleve, el tío de Clifton. ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo? Es la historia de un hombre ordinario con la habilidad para sobreponerse a sus circunstancias y alcanzar una vida mejor. Basado en su propia experiencia de vida, el nominado al premio Pulitzer, Clifton Taulbert forma equipo con el líder empresarial Gary Schoeniger, para crear una historia poderosa y convincente que captura la esencia de la mentalidad empresarial y las ilimitadas oportunidades que esta puede ofrecer. A partir de las lecciones de vida que obtuvo de su Tío Cleve, ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo?, describe la travesía de Taulbert desde su vida en el Delta del Mississippi, en la cúspide de la segregación legal, hasta ser considerado por la revista Time como uno de los más reconocidos empresarios emergentes de los Estados Unidos. Mientras Taulbert describe la influencia transformadora del Tio Cleve en su vida, Schoeniger captura las lecciones de vida emprendedora y las oportunidades ilimitadas que éstas pueden proveer. ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo? Llega al pasado para recordarnos los principios universales y atemporales que pueden empoderar a cualquiera para triunfar.Author and entrepreneur Gary Schoeniger has emerged as an internationally recognized thought leader in the field of entrepreneurial mindset education and training. Drawing from more than 15 years of research, Schoeniger has developed entrepreneurial education and training programs for academic, corporate, government, and non-government clients worldwide including the Cisco Entrepreneur Institute and the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. Schoeniger led the design and development of the Ice House Entrepreneurship Program through a partnership with the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.El poder de la pasiónBelarmino García«Sin riesgo, no hay diversión». Este lema le dio fuerza a Belarmino García para salir de la zona de confort y liderar un proyecto que muchos expertos daban por fallido antes de nacer. Con un equipo de jóvenes aguerridos y ganas de comerse el mundo, Amena saltó al mercado en 1999 e hizo frente a dos gigantes de las telecomunicaciones rompiendo el statu quo. El autor cuenta en este libro que a priori no existen situaciones predeterminadas. ¿Por qué un tercer operador no puede ser más rápido y ágil que sus competidores? ¿Por qué un nuevo jugador no puede reescribir las reglas de juego del mercado? ¿Por qué hay que contentarse con alcanzar una cima sin cuestionar que pueden existir otras más altas? Estas son algunas de las preguntas que se formuló aquel equipo que impactó al mercado con una marca de gran valor para nuestro país. A través de la gestión de las personas y una firme defensa de la innovación; en una carrera contrarreloj, sin miedo, con esfuerzo y mucho trabajo, pero, sobre todo, con mucha Pasión, alcanzaron cimas inimaginables.Belarmino García es ingeniero técnico de Telecomunicaciones, máster en Dirección Comercial y Marketing y diplomado en Dirección y Administración de Empresas. De sus primeras actividades de carácter más técnico, enseguida pasó a ejercer como ejecutivo en las áreas de ventas, marketing y dirección de negocios y empresas, trabajando en compañías como HP, Siemens Nixdorf, Amena, France Telecom o Zeerca. En la actualidad, su foco principal reside en gestionar su tiempo hacía lo que ama, incluyendo, entre otras cosas, recuperar momentos tan especiales como los vividos en Amena, que han sido fuente de inspiración y creación de este libro.

<P>"Knowledge and expertise are highly valued in today's business world. These values are introduced at an early age by our education system, and at work, we are assessed based on what we know, on having the answers and solutions. Our need for certainty, to know what's going on, to have all the answers, exerts strong pressure in our lives. This award-winning book offers an alternative, contrarian approach to dealing with such pressures - and to embrace "not knowing" rather than fearing it. The authors argue it is by "not knowing" that we in fact develop an exploratory mindset, and we discover, engage and create new ways to deal with business and management problems and issues. The book is supported by stories of individuals and the positive change they made in their lives through "not knowing". Solving new problems with old ways of thinking are no longer useful in the new world."</P><B>

Íñigo FernándezUn libro para comprender cómo el bloque en conjunto de los humanos pudo sobrevivir desde la mismísima prehistoria hasta los días de hoy, en la actualidad. Un libro en el que lo que menos aparece son reyes, fechas y datos áridos que cualquier persona puede consultar en una enciclopedia. Este repaso global es la vibrante narración de cómo unos seres que parecían abocados al desastre cuando eran meros primates en las selvas de África, consiguieron convertirse mediante su inteligencia y superación a través de todos los años de vida, en la clase dominante por encima de todos sus vecinos naturales." La trepidante historia de la humanidad, desde las primeras tribus a las megalópolis actuales, contada esta vez desde el punto de vista de los gobernados, no de los gobernantes. Unánimemente se ha tratado la historia universal atendiendo a dos factores que desvirtúan un poco la perspectiva global del devenir de la humanidad: la perspectiva de los gobernantes y la perspectiva de Europa. Al tratar los avatares que han llevado al homo sapiens a la Luna o a las fosas abisales más profundas, la mayoría de historiadores olvidan que los hombres corrientes son verdaderos agentes de la historia y no meros objetos al servicio de los gobernantes, también olvidan que existen reinos e imperios más allá de las fronteras de Europa que han influido de un modo determinante en la humanidad: Breve Historia del Mundo viene a ofrecer una visión que huya de esos clichés y presente una historia universal concreta y novedosa.Luis Íñigo Fernández nació en Guadalajara en 1966.

Conozca la evolución histórica de estos colosos del aire, su complejidad técnica y sus excitantes aventuras. Acérquese a la historia de los dirigibles, aquellos colosos del aire que surcaron los cielos el siglo pasado y descubra por qué están tan asociados al invento del noble alemán Ferdinand von Zeppelin. Descubra la evolución histórica del dirigible y de los extraordinarios personajes que estuvieron vinculados a este medio aéreo, desde su inicial empleo bélico hasta su actual papel como aeronave que puede asumir facetas complementarias de la aviación. Conozca cómo eran las misiones de combate de los dirigibles en la Primera Guerra Mundial, las grandes tragedias de los dirigibles de posguerra, los lujos y comodidades que disfrutaron los exclusivos pasajeros de estos transatlánticos del aire y la enorme complejidad técnica que implicó su desarrollo. Carlos Lázaro ofrece al lector una visión general sobre el dirigible, cuya aparición está estrechamente relacionada con la evolución de la técnica y la mentalidad de Europa y América en la primera mitad del siglo XX. Descubra por qué hoy en día los dirigibles, después del famoso desastre del Hindenburg, siguen siendo aeronaves susceptibles de ser empleadas en diversas facetas útiles para la humanidad, como alternativa aérea en campos como la ecología, la seguridad y el transporte aéreo.Carlos Lázaro es Doctor en Antropología de América.

Desde el Mary Celeste, el submarino U-31 y el portaviones Invincible hasta sucesos propios de leyendas marinas, sin olvidar al gato Oskar, que tripuló varios navíos durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Descubra las historias más entrañables o desgarradoras, trágicas o enigmáticas, pero siempre interesantes, experiencias en las que el azar y las circunstancias nos demuestran que a veces, en este mundo, la imperante rutina puede ser tan sólo la excepción. Asómbrese con los barcos que aparecieron sin sus tripulantes, colisiones a pleno día de buques dirigidos por profesionales, submarinos que regresaron del pasado o de la tumba por condicionantes técnicos o propósitos inconfesables, varadas simultáneas de flotillas enteras de buques, un pescador que se convierte en el único hombre en ver caer una bomba atómica y pescar un submarino, tesoros emprendiendo viajes de ida y vuelta o modernos buques que intentan pasar a través de tierra. Víctor San Juan con un estilo fluido y lleno de humor le acercará a todos estos hechos difíciles de creer pero que, una vez conocidos, nos sorprenden, admiran y llenan de preguntas y curiosidad.Víctor San Juan (Madrid, 1963), ingeniero, escritor y navegante titulado, ha publicado anteriormente ensayos como 'Trafalgar, tres armadas en combate' (2005) con ocasión del bicentenario de dicho evento y que le supuso la concesión de la Medalla San Telmo de la Fundación Letras de La Mar en 2006; 'La batalla naval de las Dunas.

España y Francia en guerra: Uno de los conflictos más decisivos de la Modernidad. El Imperio español, la etapa de mayor esplendor cultural y político de España, comienza a cimentarse cuando Carlos de Gante (Carlos I de España y V del Sacro Imperio Romano Germánico) se enfrenta a un joven rey de Francia, Francisco I, para luchar por la supremacía en el continente europeo.En los primeros años del siglo XVI Carlos I se enfrenta duramente a Francisco I de Francia. El objetivo: controlar gran parte del territorio italiano de cara a convertirse en el primer gran emperador de Europa. Italia, sede en esos momentos del poder temporal de la Iglesia, era una región débil políticamente y rica para atraer la voracidad de las grandes monarquías europeas.La batalla de Pavía, el Saco de Roma, la invasión de Saboya y las posteriores alianzas matrimoniales fueron los principales hitos que protagonizó Carlos I, futuro emperador del Sacro Imperio. El control del Milanesado, del Reino de Navarra ponen en jaque a las dos mayores potencias mundiales: Francia y España que ansían coronarse como grandes Imperios. Carlos I apoya su ejército gracias a las alianzas de sus hermanas con algunos de los grandes reyes de Europa (Dinamarca, Portugal,…).Nada parece frenar al emperador en la pugna por los derechos de la corona de Nápoles y del ducado de Milán, que se convirtió en el epicentro en torno al que se animaban todos los combates de una de las épocas más apasionantes de la historia de Europa.Antonio Muñoz Lorente (Badalona, 1966).

Ocho Lecciones de Vida de un Empresario ImprobableGary G. Schoeniger & Clifton L. Taulbert, Clifton L. TaulbertA finales de los anos 50, Glen Allan Mississippi era una comunidad algodonera muy pobre. Para muchos, era un tiempo y lugar donde las oportunidades eran limitadas por normas sociales y legales que estaban fuera de su control. Era un tiempo y lugar en donde pocos se atrevían a soñar. Para la mayoría el trabajo estaba en el campo, donde el sol era ardiente, los días largos y la paga muy poca. Era una forma de vida aceptada que se había transmitido de generación en generación, y desde el momento en que el joven Clifton Taulbert pudo caminar, se esperaba que él también se subiera en el camión del Señor Walters y encontrara un lugar entre sus compañeros. Sin embargo, un hombre marcó la diferencia,un empresario improbable que desafió lo convencional y se atrevió a soñar.

Ese hombre era Cleve, el tío de Clifton. ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo? Es la historia de un hombre ordinario con la habilidad para sobreponerse a sus circunstancias y alcanzar una vida mejor. Basado en su propia experiencia de vida, el nominado al premio Pulitzer, Clifton Taulbert forma equipo con el líder empresarial Gary Schoeniger, para crear una historia poderosa y convincente que captura la esencia de la mentalidad empresarial y las ilimitadas oportunidades que esta puede ofrecer. A partir de las lecciones de vida que obtuvo de su Tío Cleve, ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo?, describe la travesía de Taulbert desde su vida en el Delta del Mississippi, en la cúspide de la segregación legal, hasta ser considerado por la revista Time como uno de los más reconocidos empresarios emergentes de los Estados Unidos. Mientras Taulbert describe la influencia transformadora del Tio Cleve en su vida, Schoeniger captura las lecciones de vida emprendedora y las oportunidades ilimitadas que éstas pueden proveer. ¿De Quién es la Casa del Hielo? Llega al pasado para recordarnos los principios universales y atemporales que pueden empoderar a cualquiera para triunfar.Author and entrepreneur Gary Schoeniger has emerged as an internationally recognized thought leader in the field of entrepreneurial mindset education and training.

Este lema le dio fuerza a Belarmino García para salir de la zona de confort y liderar un proyecto que muchos expertos daban por fallido antes de nacer. Con un equipo de jóvenes aguerridos y ganas de comerse el mundo, Amena saltó al mercado en 1999 e hizo frente a dos gigantes de las telecomunicaciones rompiendo el statu quo. El autor cuenta en este libro que a priori no existen situaciones predeterminadas. ¿Por qué un tercer operador no puede ser más rápido y ágil que sus competidores? ¿Por qué un nuevo jugador no puede reescribir las reglas de juego del mercado? ¿Por qué hay que contentarse con alcanzar una cima sin cuestionar que pueden existir otras más altas? Estas son algunas de las preguntas que se formuló aquel equipo que impactó al mercado con una marca de gran valor para nuestro país. A través de la gestión de las personas y una firme defensa de la innovación; en una carrera contrarreloj, sin miedo, con esfuerzo y mucho trabajo, pero, sobre todo, con mucha Pasión, alcanzaron cimas inimaginables.Belarmino García es ingeniero técnico de Telecomunicaciones, máster en Dirección Comercial y Marketing y diplomado en Dirección y Administración de Empresas.

A bounty prized by invaders from the Greeks, Romans, and Vandals to the Byzantines, Arabs, and Normans, Sicily’s violently beautiful landscapes are haunted by a vibrant mix of cultures, and her soil has always been fertile ground for the literary and artistic imagination. This compelling guide uncovers the island’s multifaceted personality through the experiences of those literary figures who have managed to get under her skin, including Pindar, Cicero, Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Cervantes, DH Lawrence, Coleridge, Oscar Wilde, Truman Capote, Tennessee Williams, Ezra Pound, and Lawrence Durrell; as well as local writers who have defined the modern Italian novel, including Giuseppe di Lampedusa and Leonardo Sciascia.

PicardThe vulnerability of journalists to kidnappings was starkly illustrated by the killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff by Islamic militants in 2014. Their murder underscored the risks taken by journalists and news organisations trying to cover developments in dangerous regions of the world and has forced news enterprises to more clearly prepare for and confront issues of safety. This book explores the complex organisational issues surrounding the capture or kidnapping of journalists in areas of conflict and risk. It explores how journalists 'becoming news' is covered and the implications of that coverage, how news organisations prepare for and respond to such events, and how kidnapping and ransom insurers, victim recovery firms, journalists' families, and governments influence the actions of news enterprises. It considers how and why journalists are kidnapped, how employers and journalists' organisations respond to kidnappings and why freelancers are particularly at risk as well as suggesting best practices for preventing and responding to kidnappings.Robert G.

PicardThe vulnerability of journalists to kidnappings was starkly illustrated by the killing of James Foley and Steven Sotloff by Islamic militants in 2014. Their murder underscored the risks taken by journalists and news organisations trying to cover developments in dangerous regions of the world and has forced news enterprises to more clearly prepare for and confront issues of safety. This book explores the complex organisational issues surrounding the capture or kidnapping of journalists in areas of conflict and risk.

Ideologically defined by the colonists' formal Declaration of Independence in 1776, the struggle has taken on something a mythic character, especially in the United States. From the Boston Tea Party to Paul Revere's ride to raise the countryside of New England against the march of the Redcoats; from the heroic resistance of the militia Minutemen at the battles of Lexington and Concord to the famous crossing of the Delaware by General George Washington; and from the American travails of Bunker Hill (1775) to the final humiliation of the British at Yorktown (1781), the entire contest is now emblematic of American national identity. Stephen Conway shows that, beyond mythology, this was more than just a local conflict: rather a titanic struggle between France and Britain. The thirteen colonies were merely one frontline of an extended theatre of operations, with each superpower aiming to deliver the knockout blow. This bold new history recognizes the war as the Revolution but situates it on the wider, global canvas of European warfare.</p></div><DIV>Stephen Conway is Professor of History at University College London.
