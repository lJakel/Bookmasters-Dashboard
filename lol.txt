As ISIS seeks to expand its reach in the Middle East, its territory serves as a base for training and operations for a new generation of jihadis. Thousands of young people from the West, primarily from Europe, have traveled to join the terror organization, re-emerging as hardened fighters with military training and a network of international contacts. Many of these have now returned to their homelands, where it is feared they are planning a new series of brutal attacks.

They've sold more than 13 million smoking cessation books in 57 countries in more than 38 languages. Their reputation has been established almost entirely by word of mouth and personal recommendation.

He died in 1937, but his legacy lives on in a body of work that has inspired countless films, TV series, board games and toys, as well as other writers."}]][[{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 Arcturus Publishing\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"Arcturus Publishing\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 978-1-78428-259-2\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"978-1-78428-259-2\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 Hardcover w\/ Slipcase\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"Hardcover w\/ Slipcase\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 USD $24.95 (CAN $31.95)\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"USD $24.95 (CAN $31.95)\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 7 1\/4 x 9, 384 pages\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"7 1\/4 x 9, 384 pages\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 FICTION \/ Classics\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"FICTION \/ Classics\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 November 2016\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"November 2016\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl280\\slmult0\\cf1\\lang1033\\f0\\fs20 20 Black and White Illustrations\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","text":"20 Black and White Illustrations\\cf0\\lang9\\f1\\fs22","fontsize":"20","font":"0","color":"1"}]][[{"rtf":"\\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\pagebb\\hyphpar0\\sl480\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs48 The Way of the Samurai","text":"The Way of the Samurai","fontsize":"48","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sb90\\sa180\\sl288\\slmult0\\cf3\\b\\i\\f1\\fs24 Inazo Nitobe \\cf0\\lang9\\b0\\i0\\f2\\fs22","text":"Inazo Nitobe \\cf0\\lang9\\b0\\i0\\f2\\fs22","fontsize":"24","font":"1","color":"3"}]][[{"rtf":"\\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sa270\\sl320\\slmult0\\qj\\cf1\\f0\\fs20 This classic text by Inazo Nitobe defining the moral code of the warrior class or Samurai has had a huge impact both in the West and in Japan itself.

He taught Yoga postures, meditation, and a vegetarian and more compassionate lifestyle to westerners when he was invited to America in 1966 by the iconic pop artist Peter Max. The distinctive teachings he brought with him blend the physical discipline of Yoga, the spiritual philosophy of Vedic literature, and the interfaith ideals he pioneered. These techniques and concepts influenced a generation and a spawned Yoga culture that is flourishing today. The organization founded on his teachings, Integral Yoga International, is now a leading institute for Yoga teacher certification. Integral Yoga is the foundation for Dr. Dean Ornish's landmark work in reversing heart disease and Dr. Michael Lerner's noted Commonweal Cancer Help program.

The family spent summers at their 1820s farmhouse in Georgetown, Maine, where she met Adolph Ipcar. She and Adolph married in 1936 and the following year, they moved permanently to Maine, where she has farmed, painted, and worked on writing and illustrating books ever since. Today, Ipcar's intricate, vibrant, and fanciful artwork is known worldwide, and her paintings are in the permanent collections of numerous renowned museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art. Her unique and distinctly modern style has helped change the role of artwork in children's literature. Her stories are often about the pleasures of a simple life and the power of the imagination. In her long and illustrious career, Ipcar has written more than 30 children's books, including \"The Little Fisherman,\" (written by Margaret Wise Brown,) \"The Cat at Night,\" \"My Wonderful Christmas Tree,\" and \"One Horse Farm,\" \"The Calico Jungle,\" and three board books including \"Dahlov Ipcar's Maine Alphabet.\" Her work has earned her the prestigious Kerlan Award in Children's Literature in 1998; the Katahdin Award (a lifetime achievement award given by the Maine Library Association) in 2001; and the New England Independent Booksellers Association President's Award in 2010.

As founder and CEO of Range Rover of North America, which became Land Rover North America, he built a car company from scratch, beginning in 1986 with an investment of $7.5 million. Eight years later, this had grown to a market value of $200,000,000. During his career he has worked for six automakers on eleven different brands, including Cadillac, AMC, Jeep, Fiat, Lancia, Ferrari, Porsche, Audi, Volkswagen, Range Rover, Land Rover, and Mazda. He headed three different automotive marketing groups and was CEO of two auto companies. Today, Hughes heads a marketing consulting consortium, Brand Rules (www.brandrules.com) . As its founding president, he describes the firm's mission simply: In an over-branded marketplace, we help you learn what sets you and your company apart\\'e2\u20ac\\'a6and how to cut yourself out of the herd. William Jeanes has spent more than three decades closely associated with the auto industry.

Walter Thompson\/Detroit as a senior vice president and director of the Ford Division account. In 1985 he returned to writing. His articles have appeared in a score of the world's automotive publications and in Sports Illustrated, American Heritage, AARP The Magazine, Smithsonian Air & Space, Playboy, Parade, and The New York Times. In 1987, he became editor-in-chief of Car and Driver. During his six years as editor, he appeared regularly on CBS This Morning as its automotive expert, and his weekly radio commentary on Detroit's WJR reached 19 states.

Although reviled by Chinese intellectuals of the 1950s-1990s, who spoke of it as \"\"yellow silt clotting the arteries of the country,\"\" Confucianism has defied eradication, remaining a fundamental part of the nation's soul for 2500 years. And now, as China assumes greater ascendancy on the world economic stage, it is making a strong comeback as a pragmatic philosophy of personal as well as corporate transformation, popular in both home and boardroom. What is this complex system of ideology that stems from the teachings of a remarkable man called Confucius (Kongzi), who lived in the distant sixth century BCE? Though he left no writings of his own, the oral teachings recorded by the founder's disciples in the \\i Analects\\i0  left a profound mark on later Chinese politics and governance. They outline a system of social cohesiveness dependent upon personal virtue and self-control. For Confucius, society's harmony relied upon the appropriate behaviour of each individual within the social hierarchy; and its emphasis on practical ethics has led many to think of Confucianism as a secular philosophy rather than a religion.

Although reviled by Chinese intellectuals of the 1950s-1990s, who spoke of it as \"\"yellow silt clotting the arteries of the country,\"\" Confucianism has defied eradication, remaining a fundamental part of the nation's soul for 2500 years. And now, as China assumes greater ascendancy on the world economic stage, it is making a strong comeback as a pragmatic philosophy of personal as well as corporate transformation, popular in both home and boardroom. What is this complex system of ideology that stems from the teachings of a remarkable man called Confucius (Kongzi), who lived in the distant sixth century BCE? Though he left no writings of his own, the oral teachings recorded by the founder's disciples in the \\i Analects\\i0  left a profound mark on later Chinese politics and governance. They outline a system of social cohesiveness dependent upon personal virtue and self-control. For Confucius, society's harmony relied upon the appropriate behaviour of each individual within the social hierarchy; and its emphasis on practical ethics has led many to think of Confucianism as a secular philosophy rather than a religion. In this new, comprehensive introduction, Ronnie Littlejohn argues rather that Confucianism is profoundly spiritual, and must be treated as such.

The ubiquity of public debates about atheism, especially in conscious opposition to the perceived social threat posed by faith and religion, has been startling.

Exploring the rise of atheism as an explicit philosophical position (notably in the work of Denis Diderot), Hyman traces its development in the later ideas of Descartes, Locke, and Berkeley. Drawing also on the work of contemporary scholars like Amos Funkenstein and Michael J Buckley, the author shows that, since in recent theology the concept of God which atheists negate is changing, the triumph of its advocates may not be quite as unequivocal as Hitchens and Dawkins would have us believe.","text":"The last few years have seen a remarkable surge of popular interest in the topic of atheism.

This represents a challenge for disciplines with ever more complex subject matter, and a lost opportunity when new active learning approaches to education are yielding dramatic improvements in student learning and retention. This book aims to cover all aspects of teaching engineering and other technical subjects. It presents both practical matters and educational theories in a format useful for both new and experienced teachers. It is organized to start with specific, practical teaching applications and then leads to psychological and educational theories. The \"practical orientation\" section explains how to develop objectives and then use them to enhance student learning, and the \"theoretical orientation\" section discusses the theoretical basis for learning\/teaching and its impact on students. Written mainly for PhD students and professors in all areas of engineering, the book may be used as a text for graduate-level classes and professional workshops or by professionals who wish to read it on their own. Although the focus is engineering education, most of this book will be useful to teachers in other disciplines. Teaching is a complex human activity, so it is impossible to develop a formula that guarantees it will be excellent. However, the methods in this book will help all professors become good teachers while spending less time preparing for the classroom. This is a new edition of the well-received volume published by McGraw-Hill in 1993. It includes an entirely revised section on the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) and new sections on the characteristics of great teachers, different active learning methods, the application of technology in the classroom (from clickers to intelligent tutorial systems), and how people learn.","text":"The majority of professors have never had a formal course in education, and the most common method for learning how to teach is on-the-job training.

This book tells the compelling story of how its inhabitants (Roman Catholic Poles, Greek Catholic Ukrainians, and Jews) reacted to the sweeping political changes during and after World Wars I and II. The Eastern Front shifted back and forth, and the city changed hands seven times. At the end of each war, L'viv found itself in the hands of a different state. While serious tensions had existed among Poles, Ukrainians\/Ruthenians, and Jews in the city, before 1914 eruptions of violence were still infrequent. The changes of political control over the city during World War I led to increased intergroup frictions, new power relations, and episodes of shocking violence, particularly against Jews. The city's incorporation into the independent Polish Republic in November 1918 after a brief period of Ukrainian rule sparked intensified conflict. Ukrainians faced discrimination and political repression under the new government, and Ukrainian nationalists attacked the Polish state. In the 1930s, anti-Semitism increased sharply. During World War II, the city experienced first Soviet rule, then Nazi occupation, and finally Soviet conquest. The Nazis deported and murdered nearly all of the city's large Jewish population, and at the end of the war the Soviet forces expelled the city's Polish inhabitants. Based on archival research conducted in L'viv, Kiev, Warsaw, Vienna, Berlin, and Moscow, as well as an array of contemporary printed sources and scholarly studies, this book examines how the inhabitants of the city reacted to the changes in political control, and how ethnic and national ideologies shaped their dealings with each other.

Under Pastor Choco's leadership, New Life Covenant is the largest church in the Assemblies of God fellowship.Wilfredo was born and raised in Chicago's Humboldt Park community. When he was seventeen years old, he received Jesus as his Lord and Savior at a small Pentecostal Spanish-speaking church in the community. From that moment, his life was forever transformed.He remained in that same little church for over twenty years before he was appointed Senior Pastor in July 2000. Since then, the church has grown from a weekly attendance of 120 to 17,000 globally through church plants and more than 130 ministries reaching the most disenfranchised\\emdash the brokenhearted, poor, homeless, prostitutes, drug addicts, and gang members.Rev. De Jes\\'fas has been instrumental in the development of several community-based programs such as New Life Family Services, which operates a homeless shelter for women with children. Some of the church's other vital ministries include the Chicago Master's Commission, an intensive discipleship program for college-age students, and the Chicago Dream Center, which offers various programs and services to assist individuals and families to move toward self-sufficiency and to overcome poverty and its ill effects.Wilfredo's vision is simple: to be a church for the hurting that reaches people for Jesus.In 2012, he released his first book, Amazing Faith, in which he shares his life story and message: \"No one is beyond the transforming power of God's love. When we let Him, God fills our hearts with His love, strength, and purpose, and we become complete.\""}]][[{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl210\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs18 Influence Resources","text":"Influence Resources","fontsize":"18","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl210\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs18 978-1-938309-89-2","text":"978-1-938309-89-2","fontsize":"18","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl210\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs18 Paperback","text":"Paperback","fontsize":"18","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl210\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs18 USD $16.99 (CAN $21.95)","text":"USD $16.99 (CAN $21.95)","fontsize":"18","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl210\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs18 5 1\/2 x 8 1\/2, 304 pages","text":"5 1\/2 x 8 1\/2, 304 pages","fontsize":"18","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl210\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs18 RELIGION \/ Christian Life \/ Inspirational","text":"RELIGION \/ Christian Life \/ Inspirational","fontsize":"18","font":"0","color":"1"}]][[{"rtf":"\\viewkind4\\uc1\\pard\\pagebb\\hyphpar0\\sa10\\sl220\\slmult0\\cf1\\f0\\fs22 The Joy of Signing","text":"The Joy of Signing","fontsize":"22","font":"0","color":"1"},{"rtf":"\\pard\\hyphpar0\\sl220\\slmult0\\cf3\\b\\i\\f1\\fs20 Lottie L.

This award-winning book offers an alternative, contrarian approach to dealing with such pressures - and to embrace \"not knowing\" rather than fearing it. The authors argue it is by \"not knowing\" that we in fact develop an exploratory mindset, and we discover, engage and create new ways to deal with business and management problems and issues. The book is supported by stories of individuals and the positive change they made in their lives through \"not knowing\". Solving new problems with old ways of thinking are no longer useful in the new world.\""},{"rtf":"\\b Steven D'Souza\\b0  is the Founder and Director of Deeper Learning.
